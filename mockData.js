        "abstract": "Women and children in developing countries are often exposed to high levels of air pollution including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which may negatively impact their health, due to household combustion of biomass fuel for cooking and heating. We compared creatinine adjusted hydroxy-PAH (OH-PAH) concentrations in pregnant women in Trujillo, Peru who cook with wood to levels measured in those who cook with kerosene, liquefied petroleum gas or a combination of fuels. Seventy-nine women were recruited for the study between May and July 2004 in the first trimester of their pregnancy. Urine samples were collected from the subjects in the first, second and third trimesters for OH-PAH analyses. The concentrations of the OH-PAHs were compared across the type of fuel used for cooking and pregnancy trimesters. The relationships between OH-PAHs levels in the first trimester and concurrently measured personal exposures to PM(2.5), carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide together with their indoor and outdoor air concentrations were also investigated. Women cooking with wood or kerosene had the highest creatinine adjusted OH-PAH concentrations compared with those using gas, coal briquette or a combination of fuels. Concentrations of creatinine adjusted 2-hydroxy-fluorene, 3-hydroxy-fluorene, 1-hydroxy-fluorene, 2-hydroxy-phenanthrene and 4-hydroxy-phenanthrene were significantly higher (p<0.05) in women who used wood or kerosene alone compared with women who used liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), coal briquette or a combination of fuels. An increase in the concentrations of creatinine adjusted 9-hydroxy-fluorene, 1-hydroxy-phenanthrene, 2-hydroxy-phenanthrene, 4-hydroxy-phenanthrene and 1-hydroxy-pyrene in the third trimesters was also observed. Weak positive correlation (Spearman correlation coefficient, rho<0.4; p<0.05) was observed between all first trimester creatinine adjusted OH-PAHs and indoor (kitchen and living room), and personal 48-h TWA PM(2.5). Women who cooked exclusively with wood or kerosene had higher creatinine adjusted OH-PAH levels in their urine samples compared to women who cooked with LPG or coal briquette.",

        "abstract": "In July and September 2007, miners working in Kitaka Cave, Uganda, were diagnosed with Marburg hemorrhagic fever. The likely source of infection in the cave was Egyptian fruit bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus) based on detection of Marburg virus RNA in 31/611 (5.1%) bats, virus-specific antibody in bat sera, and isolation of genetically diverse virus from bat tissues. The virus isolates were collected nine months apart, demonstrating long-term virus circulation. The bat colony was estimated to be over 100,000 animals using mark and re-capture methods, predicting the presence of over 5,000 virus-infected bats. The genetically diverse virus genome sequences from bats and miners closely matched. These data indicate common Egyptian fruit bats can represent a major natural reservoir and source of Marburg virus with potential for spillover into humans.",

This approach overemphasises outcomes and focuses on quantitative benchmarks without sufficient regard to developing systems to monitor appropriate programme practice to achieve a minimum standard of TB care services. The RNTCP has developed a novel composite indicator tool based on a logical framework pathway to move beyond narrow-focused outcome indicators such as case detection to encourage a broad-based analysis of programme implementation. The constituent indicators are from routinely monitored information, spanning input, process, output and outcome indicators across various thematic categories of the RNTCP.",

We conducted a systematic search and qualitatively reviewed 13 published studies and three recent conference presentations to identify evidence-informed retention strategies. We extracted information on study design, methods, and intervention characteristics. Strengths-based case management that encourages clients to recognize and use their own internal abilities to access resources and solve problems offered strong evidence for retention in care. Other evidence-informed strategies included peer navigation, reducing structural- and system-level barriers, including peers as part of a health care team, displaying posters and brochures in waiting rooms, having medical providers present brief messages to patients, and having clinics stay in closer contact with patients across time. Opportunities for additional intervention strategies include using community-based organizations as a setting for engaging HIV-infected persons about the importance of regular care and involving patients' significant others in retention in care interventions.",

        "abstract": "AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Insulin autoantibodies (IAA) are important in type 1 diabetes risk assessment. However, their determination varies more between laboratories than other diabetes autoantibodies. The Diabetes Antibody Standardization Program (DASP) aims to improve and standardise measurement of autoantibodies associated with type 1 diabetes. We report the results of measurement of IAA from DASP workshops in 2002, 2003 and 2005. METHODS: Up to 32 laboratories in 14 countries participated in each workshop. Aliquots of coded sera from 50 patients with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes and 100 blood donor controls were circulated to participating laboratories. Reported results were analysed using receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves. We compared concordance of antibody levels by ranking, IAA and insulin antibody (IA) indices and units derived from an IA standard curve. RESULTS: In all three workshops IAA assay performance had improved compared with DASP 2000. The median area under the ROC curve was 0.73 in DASP 2002, 0.78 in 2003 and 0.80 in 2005 (p = 0.0012), and median laboratory-assigned sensitivity was 26% in 2002, 36% in 2003 and 45% in 2005 (p < 0.0001). There was, however, marked variation between assays. The range of AUC was 0.36-0.91 and that of laboratory-assigned sensitivity was 22-57%. Concordance of ranking of patient serum samples was related to AUC (p < 0.001). Using an index related to common IAA and IA-positive or -negative control sera improved the concordance between assays (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The overall performance of IAA assays has improved but there is still wide variation between laboratories. Concordance between assays would be improved by the use of a common reference reagent.",

        "abstract": "Skin immunization is effective against a number of infectious diseases, including smallpox and tuberculosis, but is difficult to administer. Here, we assessed the use of an easy-to-administer microneedle (MN) patch for skin vaccination using an inactivated rotavirus vaccine (IRV) in mice. Female inbred BALB/c mice in groups of six were immunized once in the skin using MN coated with 5mcg or 0.5mcg of inactivated rotavirus antigen or by intramuscular (IM) injection with 5mcg or 0.5mcg of the same antigen, bled at 0 and 10 days, and exsanguinated at 28 days. Rotavirus-specific IgG titers increased over time in sera of mice immunized with IRV using MN or IM injection. However, titers of IgG and neutralizing activity were generally higher in MN immunized mice than in IM immunized mice; the titers in mice that received 0.5mcg of antigen with MN were comparable or higher than those that received 5mcg of antigen IM, indicating dose sparing. None of the mice receiving negative-control, antigen-free MN had any IgG titers. In addition, MN immunization was at least as effective as IM administration in inducing a memory response of dendritic cells in the spleen. Our findings demonstrate that MN delivery can reduce the IRV dose needed to mount a robust immune response compared to IM injection and holds promise as a strategy for developing a safer and more effective rotavirus vaccine for use among children throughout the world.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Participation in physical activity brings health benefits for adolescents. However, limited data are available on the percentage of U.S. adolescents who engage in levels of aerobic and muscle-strengthening activities recommended in the 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans (2008 Guidelines). PURPOSE: To examine the prevalence at which U.S. adolescents aged 12-17 years meet the 2008 Guidelines, and whether demographic and BMI variables influence that prevalence. METHODS: Using data from an interviewer-administered self-report questionnaire in the 1999-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (analyzed in 2011), estimates were made of the percentage of adolescents who engaged in recommended levels of aerobic and muscle-strengthening activities (>/=60 minutes of aerobic activity/day and participation in muscle-strengthening activities >/=3 days/week). RESULTS: Among 6547 U.S. adolescents aged 12-17 years, 16.3% (95% CI=14.9%, 17.9%) met both aerobic and muscle-strengthening guidelines; 14.7% (13.3%, 16.2%) met the aerobic guideline only, 21.3% (19.4%, 23.3%) met the muscle-strengthening guideline only, and 47.8% (45.4%, 50.1%) met neither guideline. Adjusted for covariates, odds of meeting either the aerobic or muscle-strengthening guideline only or both guidelines versus meeting neither guideline were (p<0.05) higher among boys than girls. The odds of meeting the aerobic guideline only were higher among underweight/normal-weight adolescents than among obese adolescents. No clear pattern was observed by family groups according to poverty-to-income ratio. CONCLUSIONS: Less than 20% of adolescents reported engaging in recommended levels of both aerobic and muscle-strengthening activities.",

        "abstract": "The largest ever Ebola virus disease outbreak is ravaging West Africa. The constellation of little public health infrastructure, low levels of health literacy, limited acute care and infection prevention and control resources, densely populated areas, and a highly transmissible and lethal viral infection have led to thousands of confirmed, probable, or suspected cases thus far. Ebola virus disease is characterized by a febrile severe illness with profound gastrointestinal manifestations and is complicated by intravascular volume depletion, shock, profound electrolyte abnormalities, and organ dysfunction. Despite no proven Ebola virus-specific medical therapies, the potential effect of supportive care is great for a condition with high baseline mortality and one usually occurring in resource-constrained settings. With more personnel, basic monitoring, and supportive treatment, many of the sickest patients with Ebola virus disease do not need to die. Ebola virus disease represents an illness ready for a paradigm shift in care delivery and outcomes, and the profession of critical care medicine can and should be instrumental in helping this happen.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: We estimated smoking prevalence, frequency, intensity, and cessation attempts among US adults with selected diagnosed lifetime mental illnesses. METHODS: We used data from the 2007 National Health Interview Survey on 23,393 noninstitutionalized US adults to obtain age-adjusted estimates of smoking prevalence, frequency, intensity, and cessation attempts for adults screened as having serious psychological distress and persons self-reporting bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, attention deficit disorder or hyperactivity, dementia, or phobias or fears. RESULTS: The age-adjusted smoking prevalence of adults with mental illness or serious psychological distress ranged from 34.3% (phobias or fears) to 59.1% (schizophrenia) compared with 18.3% of adults with no such illness. Smoking prevalence increased with the number of comorbid mental illnesses. Cessation attempts among persons with diagnosed mental illness or serious psychological distress were comparable to attempts among adults without mental illnesses or distress; however, lower quit ratios were observed among adults with these diagnoses, indicating lower success in quitting. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of current smoking was higher among persons with mental illnesses than among adults without mental illnesses. Our findings stress the need for prevention and cessation efforts targeting adults with mental illnesses.",

        "abstract": "CONTEXT: Dyslipidemias represent a spectrum of lipid disorders that are important risk factors for cardiovascular disease. In addition, elevated triglycerides are known to be associated with pancreatitis. Though less clear, it is possible that dyslipidemias may also contribute to risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE). Ethinyl estradiol and progestogen, contained within combined hormonal contraception, are known to impact lipid metabolism. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate from the literature whether use of combined hormonal contraception (CHC), including combined oral contraception (COC) pills, transdermal patch, vaginal ring or injectables, modifies the relative risk of acute myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, VTE or pancreatitis among women with known dyslipidemias and to determine if existing lipid abnormalities worsen with CHC use. METHODS: PubMed and the Cochrane Library databases were searched for all articles in all languages published between inception and September 2014 relevant to dyslipidemia, CHC use and serious adverse events (MI, stroke, VTE or pancreatitis). The quality of each individual study was assessed using the system for grading evidence developed by the United States Preventive Services Task Force. RESULTS: From 306 articles identified by our search strategy, 3 articles met inclusion criteria. In a poor-quality case-control study, women with hypercholesterolemia but no COC use had an increased risk of MI (adjusted odds ratio [adj OR] 3.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.6-6.8), as did women who used COCs but did not have hypercholesterolemia (adj OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.4-2.8), compared with non-COC users without hypercholesterolemia; women with both COC use and hypercholesterolemia had an adjusted OR of 24.7 (95% CI 5.6-108.5) compared with women with neither risk factor. A poor-quality cohort study examined COC users and reported that women with dyslipidemia had increased risk for VTE [crude risk ratio (RR) 1.39, 95% CI 1.04-1.85] and transient ischemic attacks or cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) (RR 1.76, 95% CI 1.51-2.06) compared to those without dyslipidemia. Another poor-quality cohort study provided direct evidence on changes in lipid levels among COC users with dyslipidemia. A minority of women with elevated total cholesterol or triglyceride levels at baseline showed normal results (25% and 28%, respectively) after 6 cycles of COC use. No evidence regarding risks associated with use of other CHC methods was identified. No evidence was identified for the outcome of pancreatitis. CONCLUSIONS: Limited data from poor-quality observational studies suggest that women with known dyslipidemias using CHC may be at increased risk for MI and may experience a minimal increase in risk for CVA or VTE. No evidence was identified on risk for pancreatitis in this context. The impact of CHC exposure on the status of lipid abnormalities over time, an intermediate marker for disease, is also unclear. Given the significant limitations of this body of evidence, the importance of access to effective contraception and theoretical concerns raised about the use of CHCs by women with known dyslipidemias, additional rigorous studies are needed to best estimate true associations. Contraceptive decision making should include consideration of both the known and theoretical risks of a given CHC method, safety and acceptability of alternative contraceptive methods, and risks associated with unintended pregnancy.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The importance of tobacco tax structure in determining the relative prices of different tobacco products and brands has become increasingly recognized. The structuring of tobacco tax across products and brands within a country can impact the variability of prices within a country, shaping consumption and influencing tobacco users' incentives to switch down to cheaper alternatives in response to tax and price increases. METHODS: Brand-specific data on the average prices paid for the top 5 cigarette brands in 13 countries were obtained from the Global Adult Tobacco Survey, and for the United States, data were obtained from the National Adult Tobacco Survey. The variability of cigarette prices paid across brands was analyzed in the context of each country's tobacco tax structure. RESULTS: Countries with simpler cigarette tax structures, particularly those that emphasize specific taxes and do not involve tier-based taxes, exhibit less variability in the prices smokers pay for cigarettes across brands. CONCLUSIONS: Increases in cigarette taxes in countries with simpler tax structures will be more effective in reducing cigarette smoking and its health and economic consequences than comparable tax increases in countries where tax structures are more complicated and there are greater opportunities for switching to cheaper brands in order to avoid a tax increase.",

        "abstract": "To explore definitions for multisite pain, and compare associations with risk factors for different patterns of musculoskeletal pain, we analysed cross-sectional data from the Cultural and Psychosocial Influences on Disability (CUPID) study. The study sample comprised 12,410 adults aged 20-59 years from 47 occupational groups in 18 countries. A standardised questionnaire was used to collect information about pain in the past month at each of 10 anatomical sites, and about potential risk factors. Associations with pain outcomes were assessed by Poisson regression, and characterised by prevalence rate ratios (PRRs). Extensive pain, affecting 6-10 anatomical sites, was reported much more frequently than would be expected if the occurrence of pain at each site were independent (674 participants vs 41.9 expected). In comparison with pain involving only 1-3 sites, it showed much stronger associations (relative to no pain) with risk factors such as female sex (PRR 1.6 vs 1.1), older age (PRR 2.6 vs 1.1), somatising tendency (PRR 4.6 vs 1.3), and exposure to multiple physically stressing occupational activities (PRR 5.0 vs 1.4). After adjustment for number of sites with pain, these risk factors showed no additional association with a distribution of pain that was widespread according to the frequently used American College of Rheumatology criteria. Our analysis supports the classification of pain at multiple anatomical sites simply by the number of sites affected, and suggests that extensive pain differs importantly in its associations with risk factors from pain that is limited to only a small number of anatomical sites.",

RESULTS: Among 57 554 matched vaccinated and unvaccinated pregnant women, including 16 240 women in the first trimester, maternal vaccination was not associated with increased or decreased risk for preterm birth (OR for delivery at <37 weeks gestation, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.93-1.02]; for delivery at </=32 weeks gestation, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.86-1.12]; and for delivery at </=34 weeks gestation, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.88-1.04]) or SGA birth (OR for <5th percentile weight for gestational age, 1.02 [95% CI, 0.96-1.09], and for <10th percentile weight for gestational age, 1.00 [95% CI, 0.96-1.04]). Similarly, first trimester vaccination was not associated with increased or decreased risk for preterm or SGA birth. CONCLUSION: Receipt of trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine during pregnancy was not associated with increased or decreased risk of preterm or SGA birth. These findings support the safety of vaccinating pregnant women against influenza during the first, second, and third trimesters, and suggest that a nonspecific protective effect of the influenza vaccine for these outcomes does not exist.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Broth-based culture (BBC) systems are increasingly being used to detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) in resource-limited. We evaluated the performance, time to detection and cost of the Capilia TB identification test from broth cultures positive for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) in Thailand. METHODS: From October-December 2007, broth cultures that grew AFB from specimens submitted by district TB clinics to the Bangkok city laboratory were tested for MTBC using Capilia TB and standard biochemical tests. Isolates that were identified as MTBC by biochemical tests but not by Capilia TB underwent repeat testing using Capilia TB, Accuprobe (Gen-Probe, San Diego, CA, USA) and sequencing. Costs of time, labour, infrastructure and consumables for all procedures were measured. RESULTS: Of 247 isolates evaluated, the sensitivity of Capilia TB was 97% and its true specificity 100% compared with biochemical testing. The median time from specimen receipt to confirmed MTBC identification was 20 days (range 7-53 days) for Capilia TB and 45 days (range 35-79 days) for biochemical testing (P < 0.01). Six isolates that were Capilia TB negative but positive by biochemical testing were confirmed as MTBC and mutations in the mpb64 gene were detected in all. The unit cost of using Capilia TB was 2.67 USD that of biochemical testing was 8.78 USD. CONCLUSIONS: In Thailand, Capilia TB had acceptable sensitivity and specificity, was lower in cost and had shorter turn-around times. Laboratories investing in BBC should consider Capilia TB for identification of MTBC, after validation of performance in their setting.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To examine patterns and trends of undervaccination in children aged 2 to 24 months and to compare health care utilization rates between undervaccinated and age-appropriately vaccinated children. DESIGN: Retrospective matched cohort study. SETTING: Eight managed care organizations of the Vaccine Safety Datalink. PARTICIPANTS: Children born between 2004 and 2008. MAIN EXPOSURE: Immunization records were used to calculate the average number of days undervaccinated. Two matched cohorts were created: 1 with children who were undervaccinated for any reason and 1 with children who were undervaccinated because of parental choice. For both cohorts, undervaccinated children were matched to age-appropriately vaccinated children by birth date, managed care organization, and sex. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rates of undervaccination, specific patterns of undervaccination, and health care utilization rates. RESULTS: Of 323,247 children born between 2004 and 2008, 48.7% were undervaccinated for at least 1 day before age 24 months. The prevalence of undervaccination and specific patterns of undervaccination increased over time (P < .001). In a matched cohort analysis, undervaccinated children had lower outpatient visit rates compared with children who were age-appropriately vaccinated (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.89; 95% CI, 0.89- 0.90). In contrast, undervaccinated children had increased inpatient admission rates compared with age-appropriately vaccinated children (IRR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.18-1.23). In a second matched cohort analysis, children who were undervaccinated because of parental choice had lower rates of outpatient visits (IRR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.93-0.95) and emergency department encounters (IRR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.88-0.94) than age-appropriately vaccinated children. CONCLUSIONS: Undervaccination appears to be an increasing trend. Undervaccinated children appear to have different health care utilization patterns compared with age-appropriately vaccinated children.",

        "abstract": "Inherited cardiovascular conditions (ICCs) are a group of monogenic disorders caused by mutations in the components of the electrical and contractile system of the heart or its vasculature. ICCs include arrhythmias, cardiomyopathies, inherited arteriopathies such as Marfan syndrome, muscular dystrophies, and familial hypercholesterolaemia. Epidemiological data on ICCs are sparse but a survey of the available literature suggests that there are approximately 340,000 prevalent cases of these conditions in the UK (population 61 million). As a result of dramatic advances in understanding of the molecular pathology of ICCs, more than 50 ICCs have been recognised, and diagnostic genetic tests are increasingly available. As part of a needs assessment and review of provision of ICC services, a survey of all UK ICC services was undertaken focusing on both quantitative and qualitative aspects. Service provision was found to be highly inequitable, with typically a 10-20-fold variation in referral and genetic testing rates between different UK regions. Service levels per million population are much higher in London than in all but one of the regions. The review concluded that capacity of services is inadequate to meet current or future demand and many services lack the critical mass to provide the full range of services. Recommendations are made for the development of services appropriate for the future. Services should be led by cardiology but have close links with clinical genetics services, which should provide support with specialist genetics advice and cascade testing. Finally, the international relevance of this review is considered.",

We examined antimicrobial prophylaxis (AMP) regimens used for these operations and compared their spectrum of activity against reported SSI pathogens. METHODS: Pathogen distributions of CABG and hip/knee arthroplasty complex SSIs (deep and organ/space) reported to the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) from 2006 through 2009 and AMP regimens (same procedures and time period) reported to the Surgical Care Improvement Project (SCIP) were analyzed. Regimens were categorized as standard (cefazolin or cefuroxime), beta-lactam allergy (vancomycin or clindamycin with or without an aminoglycoside), and extended spectrum (vancomycin and/or an aminoglycoside with cefazolin or cefuroxime). AMP activity of each regimen was predicted on the basis of pathogen susceptibility reports and published spectra of antimicrobial activity. RESULTS: There were 6,263 CABG and arthroplasty complex SSIs reported (680,489 procedures; 880 NHSN hospitals). Among 6,574 pathogens reported, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (23%), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (18%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (17%), and Enterococcus species (7%) were most common. AMP regimens for 2,435,703 CABG and arthroplasty procedures from 3,330 SCIP hospitals were analyzed. The proportion of pathogens predictably susceptible to standard (used in 75% of procedures), beta-lactam (12%), and extended-spectrum (8%) regimens was 41%-45%, 47%-96%, and 81%-96%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Standard AMP, used in three-quarters of CABG and primary arthroplasty procedures, has inadequate activity against more than half of SSI pathogens reported. Alternative strategies may be needed to prevent SSIs caused by pathogens resistant to standard AMP regimens.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In 2008 all WHO member states endorsed a target of 90% reduction in measles mortality by 2010 over 2000 levels. We developed a model to estimate progress made towards this goal. METHODS: We constructed a state-space model with population and immunisation coverage estimates and reported surveillance data to estimate annual national measles cases, distributed across age classes. We estimated deaths by applying age-specific and country-specific case-fatality ratios to estimated cases in each age-country class. FINDINGS: Estimated global measles mortality decreased 74% from 535,300 deaths (95% CI 347,200-976,400) in 2000 to 139,300 (71,200-447,800) in 2010. Measles mortality was reduced by more than three-quarters in all WHO regions except the WHO southeast Asia region. India accounted for 47% of estimated measles mortality in 2010, and the WHO African region accounted for 36%. INTERPRETATION: Despite rapid progress in measles control from 2000 to 2007, delayed implementation of accelerated disease control in India and continued outbreaks in Africa stalled momentum towards the 2010 global measles mortality reduction goal. Intensified control measures and renewed political and financial commitment are needed to achieve mortality reduction targets and lay the foundation for future global eradication of measles.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Employer support is important for mothers, as returning to work is a common reason for discontinuing breastfeeding. This article explores support available to breastfeeding employees of hospitals that provide maternity care. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to describe the prevalence of 7 different types of worksite support and changes in these supports available to breastfeeding employees at hospitals that provide maternity care from 2007 to 2011. METHODS: Hospital data from the 2007, 2009, and 2011 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Survey on Maternity Practices in Infant Nutrition and Care (mPINC) were analyzed. Survey respondents were asked if the hospital provides any of the following supports to hospital staff: (1) a designated room to express milk, (2) on-site child care, (3) an electric breast pump, (4) permission to use existing work breaks to express milk, (5) a breastfeeding support group, (6) lactation consultant/specialist available for consult, and (7) paid maternity leave other than accrued vacation or sick leave. This study was exempt from ethical approval because it was a secondary analysis of a publicly available dataset. RESULTS: Of the 7 worksite supports in hospitals measured, 6 increased and 1 decreased from 2007 to 2011. Across all survey years, more than 70% of hospitals provided supports for expressing breast milk, whereas less than 15% provided direct access to the breastfeeding child through on-site child care, and less than 35% offered paid maternity leave. Results differed by region and hospital size and type. In 2011, only 2% of maternity hospitals provided all 7 worksite supports; 40% provided 5 or more. CONCLUSION: The majority of maternity care hospitals (> 70%) offer breastfeeding supports that allow employees to express breast milk. Supports that provide direct access to the breastfeeding child, which would allow employees to breastfeed at the breast, and access to breastfeeding support groups are much less frequent than other supports, suggesting opportunities for improvement.",

        "abstract": "Conventional diagnosis of histoplasmosis presents difficulties delaying diagnosis, indicating the need for implementation of molecular assays. We evaluated 146 clinical samples from 135 patients suspected to have histoplasmosis using a previously reported nested PCR assay (Hc100). In order to determine the specificity of this molecular test, we also used samples from healthy individuals (n=20), from patients suspected to have respiratory disease with negative fungal cultures (n=29), and patients with other proven infections (n=60). Additionally, a sizable collection of DNA from cultures of H.capsulatum and other medically relevant pathogens were studied. A panfungal PCR assay amplifying the ITS2 region was also used to identify all fungal DNAs. All PCR amplified products were sequenced. From the 146 clinical samples, 67 (45.9%) were positive by culture and PCR, while 9 samples negative by culture were positive by PCR. All the sequences corresponding to the 76 amplified products presented >/=98% identity with H.capsulatum. The Hc100 PCR exhibited a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 92.4% and 95.2% when compared to negative controls nd to samples from other proven clinical entities, respectively; PPV was 83% and NPV was 100%; the positive and negative likelihood rates were 25 and 0, respectively. These results suggest that the Hc100-based nested PCR assay for detection of H.capsulatum DNA is a useful test in areas where this mycosis is endemic.",

Sensitivity was lower (0.60 [CI(.95) = 0.45, 0.75]). Given diagnostic heterogeneity, and the broad array of ASD in the population, identifying children with ASD is challenging.

Until 2009, the recommendations did not address non-traveling family members or other close contacts of international adoptees. We report an outbreak of hepatitis A in 2008 that occurred in Maine. Eight members of an extended family developed hepatitis A following the arrival of an asymptomatic infant from Ethiopia who was brought to the United States by an adoption agency. Two children in the family attended an elementary school where five additional cases of hepatitis A were subsequently identified. Only three (1%) of 208 students at the school had previously been immunized against hepatitis A. This outbreak highlights the need to immunize household members and other close contacts of families adopting children from countries where hepatitis A is endemic, as well as all children at one year of age.",

        "abstract": "The American Conference of Governmental Industrial hygienists (ACGIH) lowered the threshold limit value (TLV) for respirable crystalline silica (RCS) exposure from 0.05 to 0.025 mg m(-3) in 2006. For a working environment with an airborne dust concentration near this lowered TLV, the sample collected with current standard respirable aerosol samplers might not provide enough RCS for quantitative analysis. Adopting high flow rate sampling devices for respirable dust containing silica may provide a sufficient amount of RCS to be above the limit of quantification even for samples collected for less than full shift. The performances of three high flow rate respirable samplers (CIP10-R, GK2.69, and FSP10) have been evaluated in this study. Eleven different sizes of monodisperse aerosols of ammonium fluorescein were generated with a vibrating orifice aerosol generator in a calm air chamber in order to determine the sampling efficiency of each sampler. Aluminum oxide particles generated by a fluidized bed aerosol generator were used to test (i) the uniformity of a modified calm air chamber, (ii) the effect of loading on the sampling efficiency, and (iii) the performance of dust collection compared to lower flow rate cyclones in common use in the USA (10-mm nylon and Higgins-Dewell cyclones). The coefficient of variation for eight simultaneous samples in the modified calm air chamber ranged from 1.9 to 6.1% for triplicate measures of three different aerosols. The 50% cutoff size ((50)d(ae)) of the high flow rate samplers operated at the flow rates recommended by manufacturers were determined as 4.7, 4.1, and 4.8 mum for CIP10-R, GK2.69, and FSP10, respectively. The mass concentration ratio of the high flow rate samplers to the low flow rate cyclones decreased with decreasing mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) and high flow rate samplers collected more dust than low flow rate samplers by a range of 2-11 times based on gravimetric analysis. Dust loading inside the high flow rate samplers does not appear to affect the particle separation in either FSP10 or GK2.69. The high flow rate samplers overestimated compared to the International Standards Organization/Comite Europeen de Normalisation/ACGIH respirable convention [up to 40% at large MMAD (27.5 mum)] and could provide overestimated exposure data with the current flow rates. However, both cyclones appeared to be able to provide relatively unbiased assessments of RCS when their flow rates were adjusted.",

        "abstract": "Water safety plans (WSPs) are endorsed by the World Health Organization as the most effective method of protecting a water supply. With the increase in WSPs worldwide, several valuable resources have been developed to assist practitioners in the implementation of WSPs, yet there is still a need for a practical and standardized method of evaluating WSP effectiveness. In 2012, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a conceptual framework for the evaluation of WSPs, presenting four key outcomes of the WSP process: institutional, operational, financial and policy change. In this paper, we seek to operationalize this conceptual framework by providing a set of simple and practical indicators for assessing WSP outcomes. Using CDC's WSP framework as a foundation and incorporating various existing performance monitoring indicators for water utilities, we developed a set of approximately 25 indicators of institutional, operational, financial and policy change within the WSP context. These outcome indicators hold great potential for the continued implementation and expansion of WSPs worldwide. Having a defined framework for evaluating a WSP's effectiveness, along with a set of measurable indicators by which to carry out that evaluation, will help implementers assess key WSP outcomes internally, as well as benchmark their progress against other WSPs in their region and globally.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Our objectives were to compare the magnitude of family history as a risk factor for venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk between Blacks and Whites, and to assess the impact of co-morbid conditions on familial risk for VTE. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used data from the Genetic Attributes Thrombosis Epidemiology (GATE) study, a matched case-control study which enrolled Blacks and Whites aged 18-70years in Atlanta, Georgia. A total of 1,094 case patients with a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) and 1,264 control patients were interviewed about their family history. RESULTS: Family history of VTE was a statistically significant risk factor for VTE among Blacks (odds ratio (OR)=2.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.0-4.1; P value<0.0001) and among Whites (OR=2.7, 95% CI 1.9-3.7; P value<0.0001); among Blacks and Whites who were obese or had hypertension; among Blacks who had diabetes mellitus or cancer; as well as among males and females, and across all age categories. Family history of VTE increased the risk of VTE among Blacks with cancer by about 6-fold, whereas among Blacks without cancer the increased risk due to a positive family history was about 3-fold; a 2-fold relative difference. In addition, family history was a risk factor for VTE among case patients with DVT only or with PE only. The effect of family history generally was stronger among those with recurrent episodes of VTE compared with a first episode of VTE. For example, family history of any VTE was a strong risk factor among Black females with recurrent VTE compared with Black females with first VTE (OR=3.9, 95% CI 2.0-7.5; P value<0.0001). CONCLUSION: Our study indicated that the adjusted attributable fraction for VTE was 16.9% among Blacks vs. 18.3% among Whites, and certain co-morbid conditions could further increase the risk of VTE associated with a positive family history of VTE.",

        "abstract": "A study was conducted to detect and identify enteric microsporidian species in 43 children from Oyo state, Nigeria. Using nested polymerase chain reaction, 9.3% of the children were identified as positive for Enterocytozoon bieneusi. DNA sequencing of the PCR products showed the presence of three known genotypes (two isolates of genotype D and one of genotype K) and one new genotype. This study suggests that either human or animal (or both) could be the infection source for the children, since identified genotypes D and K have been previously detected in both immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients and domestic animals. The identification of high diversity also suggests intensive transmission of microsporidiosis in the studied area.",

        "abstract": "The actin-filament associated protein (AFAP) family of adaptor proteins consists of three members: AFAP1, AFAP1L1, and AFAP1L2/XB130 with AFAP1 being the best described as a cSrc binding partner and actin cross-linking protein. A homology search of AFAP1 recently identified AFAP1L1 which has a similar sequence, domain structure and cellular localization; however, based upon sequence variations, AFAP1L1 is hypothesized to have unique functions that are distinct from AFAP1. While AFAP1 has the ability to bind to the SH3 domain of the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase cSrc via an N-terminal SH3 binding motif, it was unable to bind cortactin. However, the SH3 binding motif of AFAP1L1 was more efficient at interacting with the SH3 domain of cortactin and not cSrc. AFAP1L1 was shown by fluorescence microscopy to decorate actin filaments and move to punctate actin structures and colocalize with cortactin, consistent with localization to invadosomes. Upon overexpression in A7r5 cells, AFAP1L1 had the ability to induce podosome formation and move to podosomes without stimulation. Immunohistochemical analysis of AFAP1L1 in human tissues shows differential expression when contrasted with AFAP1 with localization of AFAP1L1 to unique sites in muscle and the dentate nucleus of the brain where AFAP1 was not detectable. We hypothesize AFAP1L1 may play a similar role to AFAP1 in affecting changes in actin filaments and bridging interactions with binding partners, but we hypothesize that AFAP1L1 may forge unique protein interactions in which AFAP1 is less efficient, and these interactions may allow AFAP1L1 to affect invadosome formation.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To estimate influenza-associated mortality in Bangladesh in 2009. METHODS: In four hospitals in Bangladesh, respiratory samples were collected twice a month throughout 2009 from inpatients aged < 5 years with severe pneumonia and from older inpatients with severe acute respiratory infection. The samples were tested for influenza virus ribonucleic acid (RNA) using polymerase chain reaction. The deaths in 2009 in five randomly selected unions (the smallest administrative units in Bangladesh) in each hospital's catchment area were then investigated using formal records and informal group discussions. The deaths of those who had reportedly died within 14 days of suddenly developing fever with cough and/or a sore throat were assumed to be influenza-associated. The rate of such deaths in 2009 in each of the catchment areas was then estimated from the number of apparently influenza-associated deaths in the sampled unions, the proportion of the sampled inpatients in the local hospital who tested positive for influenza virus RNA, and the estimated number of residents of the sampled unions. FINDINGS: Of the 2500 people known to have died in 2009 in all 20 study unions, 346 (14%) reportedly had fever with cough and/or sore throat within 14 days of their deaths. The estimated mean annual influenza-associated mortality in these unions was 11 per 100,000 population: 1.5, 4.0 and 125 deaths per 100,000 among those aged < 5, 5-59 and > 59 years, respectively. CONCLUSION: The highest burden of influenza-associated mortality in Bangladesh in 2009 was among the elderly.",

        "abstract": "More than 800 published genetic association studies have implicated dozens of potential risk loci in Parkinson's disease (PD). To facilitate the interpretation of these findings, we have created a dedicated online resource, PDGene, that comprehensively collects and meta-analyzes all published studies in the field. A systematic literature screen of ~27,000 articles yielded 828 eligible articles from which relevant data were extracted. In addition, individual-level data from three publicly available genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were obtained and subjected to genotype imputation and analysis. Overall, we performed meta-analyses on more than seven million polymorphisms originating either from GWAS datasets and/or from smaller scale PD association studies. Meta-analyses on 147 SNPs were supplemented by unpublished GWAS data from up to 16,452 PD cases and 48,810 controls. Eleven loci showed genome-wide significant (P < 5 x 10(-8)) association with disease risk: BST1, CCDC62/HIP1R, DGKQ/GAK, GBA, LRRK2, MAPT, MCCC1/LAMP3, PARK16, SNCA, STK39, and SYT11/RAB25. In addition, we identified novel evidence for genome-wide significant association with a polymorphism in ITGA8 (rs7077361, OR 0.88, P = 1.3 x 10(-8)). All meta-analysis results are freely available on a dedicated online database (www.pdgene.org), which is cross-linked with a customized track on the UCSC Genome Browser. Our study provides an exhaustive and up-to-date summary of the status of PD genetics research that can be readily scaled to include the results of future large-scale genetics projects, including next-generation sequencing studies.",

        "abstract": "Pathogen genetics is already a mainstay of public health investigation and control efforts; now advances in technology make it possible to investigate the role of human genetic variation in the epidemiology of infectious diseases. To describe trends in this field, we analyzed articles that were published from 2001 through 2010 and indexed by the HuGE Navigator, a curated online database of PubMed abstracts in human genome epidemiology. We extracted the principal findings from all meta-analyses and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with an infectious disease-related outcome. Finally, we compared the representation of diseases in HuGE Navigator with their contributions to morbidity worldwide. We identified 3,730 articles on infectious diseases, including 27 meta-analyses and 23 GWAS. The number published each year increased from 148 in 2001 to 543 in 2010 but remained a small fraction (about 7%) of all studies in human genome epidemiology. Most articles were by authors from developed countries, but the percentage by authors from resource-limited countries increased from 9% to 25% during the period studied. The most commonly studied diseases were HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, hepatitis B infection, hepatitis C infection, sepsis, and malaria. As genomic research methods become more affordable and accessible, population-based research on infectious diseases will be able to examine the role of variation in human as well as pathogen genomes. This approach offers new opportunities for understanding infectious disease susceptibility, severity, treatment, control, and prevention.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Indigenous children in developed countries are at increased risk of chronic suppurative lung disease (CSLD), including bronchiectasis. We evaluated sociodemographic and medical factors in indigenous children with CSLD/bronchiectasis from Australia, United States (US), and New Zealand (NZ). METHODS: Indigenous children aged 0.5-8 years with CSLD/bronchiectasis were enrolled from specialist clinics in Australia (n = 97), Alaska (n = 41), and NZ (n = 42) during 2004-2009, and followed for 1-5 years. Research staff administered standardized parent interviews, reviewed medical histories and performed physical examinations at enrollment. RESULTS: Study children in all three countries had poor housing and sociodemographic circumstances at enrollment. Except for increased household crowding, most poverty indices in study participants were similar to those reported for their respective local indigenous populations. However, compared to their local indigenous populations, study children were more often born prematurely and had both an increased frequency and earlier onset of acute lower respiratory infections (ALRIs). Most (95%) study participants had prior ALRI hospitalizations and 77% reported a chronic cough in the past year. Significant differences (wheeze, ear disease and plumbed water) between countries were present. DISCUSSION: Indigenous children with CSLD/bronchiectasis from three developed countries experience significant disparities in poverty indices in common with their respective indigenous population; however, household crowding, prematurity and early ALRIs were more common in study children than their local indigenous population. Addressing equity, especially by preventing prematurity and ALRIs, should reduce risk of CSLD/bronchiectasis in indigenous children.  (Pediatr Pulmonol. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.)",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite efforts to reduce antibiotic prescribing for acute respiratory infections (ARIs), information on factors that drive prescribing is limited. OBJECTIVE: To examine trends in antibiotic prescribing in the Veterans Affairs population over an 8-year period and to identify patient, provider, and setting sources of variation. DESIGN: Retrospective, cross-sectional study. SETTING: All emergency departments and primary and urgent care clinics in the Veterans Affairs health system. PARTICIPANTS: All patient visits between 2005 and 2012 with primary diagnoses of ARIs that typically had low proportions of bacterial infection. Patients with infections or comorbid conditions that indicated antibiotic use were excluded. MEASUREMENTS: Overall antibiotic prescription; macrolide prescription; and patient, provider, and setting characteristics extracted from the electronic health record. RESULTS: The proportion of 1 million visits with ARI diagnoses that resulted in antibiotic prescriptions increased from 67.5% in 2005 to 69.2% in 2012 (P < 0.001). The proportion of macrolide antibiotics prescribed increased from 36.8% to 47.0% (P < 0.001). Antibiotic prescribing was highest for sinusitis (adjusted proportion, 86%) and bronchitis (85%) and varied little according to fever, age, setting, or comorbid conditions. Substantial variation was identified in prescribing at the provider level: The 10% of providers who prescribed the most antibiotics did so during at least 95% of their ARI visits, and the 10% who prescribed the least did so during 40% or fewer of their ARI visits. LIMITATION: Some clinical data that may have influenced the prescribing decision were missing. CONCLUSION: Veterans with ARIs commonly receive antibiotics, regardless of patient, provider, or setting characteristics. Macrolide use has increased, and substantial variation was identified in antibiotic prescribing at the provider level.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Influenza vaccines are licensed annually based on immunogenicity studies. We used five sequential years of data to estimate influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE), the critical outcome in the field. METHODS: Between 2007 and 2011, we performed annual prospective test-negative design case-control studies among adults aged 20-64 years recruited from sentinel general practices in the Australian state of Victoria. We used PCR-confirmed influenza as the endpoint to estimate influenza VE for all years. We compared annual VE estimates with the match between circulating and vaccine strains, determined by haemagglutination inhibition assays. RESULTS: The adjusted VE estimate for all years (excluding 2009) was 62% (95% CI 43, 75). By type and subtype, the point estimates of VE by year ranged between 31% for seasonal influenza A(H1N1) and 88% for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. In 2007, when circulating strains were assessed as incompletely matched, the point estimate of the adjusted VE against all influenza was 58%. The point estimate was 59% in 2011 when all strains were assessed as well matched. CONCLUSION: Trivalent inactivated vaccines provided moderate protection against laboratory-confirmed influenza in adults of working age, although VE estimates were sensitive to the model used. VE estimates correlated poorly with circulating strain match, as assessed by haemagglutination inhibition assays, suggesting a need for VE studies that incorporate antigenic characterization data.",

We assessed the prevalence of in vitro aerobic metronidazole and tinidazole resistance among T. vaginalis isolates from multiple geographic sites in the United States. Swab specimens were obtained from women who underwent routine pelvic examinations at sexually transmitted disease clinics in 6 US cities. Cultured T. vaginalis isolates were tested for nitroimidazole resistance (aerobic minimum lethal concentration [MLC] >50 microg/mL). Of 538 T. vaginalis isolates, 23 (4.3%) exhibited low-level in vitro metronidazole resistance (minimum lethal concentrations 50-100 microg/mL). No isolates exhibited moderate- to high-level metronidazole resistance or tinidazole resistance. Results highlight the possibility that reliance on a single class of antimicrobial drugs for treating T. vaginalis infections may heighten vulnerability to emergence of resistance. Thus, novel treatment options are needed.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Overall HIV mortality rates in China have not been reported. In this analysis we assess overall mortality in treatment-eligible adults with HIV and attempt to identify risk factors for HIV-related mortality. METHODS: We used data from the national HIV epidemiology and treatment databases to identify individuals aged 15 years or older with HIV who were eligible for highly active antiretroviral therapy between 1985 and 2009. Mortality rates were calculated in terms of person-years, with risk factors determined by Cox proportional hazard regression. Treatment coverage was calculated as the proportion of time that patients who were eligible for treatment received treatment, with risk factors for not receiving treatment identified by use of logistic regression. FINDINGS: Of 323 252 people reported as having HIV in China by the end of 2009, 145 484 (45%) were identified as treatment-eligible and included in this analysis. Median CD4 count was 201 cells per muL (IQR 71-315) at HIV diagnosis and 194 cells per muL (73-293) when first declared eligible for treatment. Overall mortality decreased from 39.3 per 100 person-years in 2002 to 14.2 per 100 person-years in 2009, with treatment coverage concomitantly increasing from almost zero to 63.4%. By 2009, mortality was higher and treatment coverage lower in injecting drug users (15.9 deaths per 100 person-years; 42.7% coverage) and those infected sexually (17.5 deaths per 100 person-years; 61.7% coverage), compared with those infected through plasma donation or blood transfusion (6.7 deaths per 100 person-years; 80.2% coverage). The two strongest risk factors for HIV-related mortality were not receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (adjusted hazard ratio 4.35, 95% CI 4.10-4.62) and having a CD4 count of less than 50 cells per muL when first declared eligible for treatment (7.92, 7.33-8.57). INTERPRETATION: An urgent need exists for earlier HIV diagnosis and better access to treatment for injecting drug users and patients infected with HIV sexually, especially before they become severely immunosuppressed.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Total body iron calculated from serum ferritin and soluble transferrin receptor concentrations allows for the evaluation of the full range of iron status. OBJECTIVE: We described the distribution of total body iron and the prevalence of iron deficiency (ID) on the basis of total body iron in US pregnant women. DESIGN: We examined data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) in 1999-2006 for 1171 pregnant women. RESULTS: ID prevalence (+/-SE) in US pregnant women, which was defined as total body iron <0 mg/kg, was 18.0 +/- 1.4%. Pregnant women in the first trimester had a higher mean total body iron than did pregnant women in the second or third trimesters. ID prevalence in pregnant women increased significantly with each trimester (6.9 +/- 2.2%, 14.3 +/- 2.1%, and 29.5 +/- 2.7% in the first, second, and third trimesters, respectively). Pregnant women with parity >/=2 had the lowest mean total body iron and the highest prevalence of ID compared with values for pregnant women with parity of 0 or 1. The ID prevalence in non-Hispanic white pregnant women was significantly lower than in Mexican American or non-Hispanic black pregnant women. The mean total body iron and the prevalence of ID did not differ by educational level or by family income. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, these are the first data on total body iron distributions for a representative sample of US pregnant women. Low total body iron is more prevalent in pregnant women in the second or third trimesters, in Mexican American pregnant women, in non-Hispanic black pregnant women, and in women with parity >/=2.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Photochemical treatment of blood products could help prevent transfusion-transmitted malaria and reduce the need for donor deferrals. In this study we evaluated the effectiveness of riboflavin and ultraviolet (UV) light against both Plasmodium falciparum, which causes the most severe form of human malaria, and Plasmodium yoelii, an in vivo murine model for malaria. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Plasma and platelet (PLT) concentrates were inoculated with either P. falciparum- or P. yoelii-infected red blood cells (RBCs). Aliquots from each unit were collected after inoculation, after addition of riboflavin, and after treatment. In vitro P. falciparum growth was assessed using thin blood films of duplicate samples at 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours. P. yoelii parasitemia was followed in mice for 14 days postinoculation. RESULTS: In the in vitro studies, the mean P. falciparum parasitemia increased 12- to 19-fold in pretreatment samples, both before and after addition of riboflavin, after 96-hour culture. Few parasites were observed in Mirasol-treated units at 24 hours; those that were observed were degenerating. Through the remainder of the 96-hour culture period, cultures of treated samples were negative. In the in vivo study, mouse plasma containing P. yoelii-infected RBCs had a mean starting titer of 4.6 log mouse infectious dose 50%/mL. No infectious parasite was detected in treated samples. CONCLUSION: Treatment with riboflavin and UV light was effective at reducing viable P. falciparum in both PLT and plasma products by at least 3.2 logs. Additionally, an at least 4.4-log reduction was observed with P. yoelii.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mucormycosis is an invasive fungal infection with a high fatality rate. We investigated an outbreak of mucormycosis in a pediatric hospital to determine routes of pathogen transmission from the environment and prevent additional infections. METHODS: A case was defined as a hospital-onset illness consistent with mucormycosis, confirmed by culture or histopathology. Case-patient medical records were reviewed for clinical course and exposure to items and locations within the hospital. Environmental samples were collected from air and surfaces. Fungal isolates collected from case-patients and the environment were identified using DNA sequencing. RESULTS: Five case-patients had hospital-associated cutaneous mucormycosis over an eleven month period; all subsequently died. Three case-patients had conditions known to be associated with susceptibility to mucormycosis, while two had cardiac conditions with persistent acidosis. The cases occurred on several different wards throughout the hospital, and hospital linens were the only exposure identified as common to the case-patients. Rhizopus species were recovered from 26 (42%) of 62 environmental samples from clean linens and associated areas, and from one (4%) of 25 samples from non-linen-related items. Case-patients were infected with Rhizopusdelemar, which was also isolated from cultures of clean linens and clean linen delivery bins from the off-site laundry facility. CONCLUSIONS: Hospital linens were identified as a vehicle that carried Rhizopusdelemar into contact with susceptible patients. Fungal species identification using DNA-based methods is useful for corroborating epidemiologic links in hospital outbreak investigations. Hospital linens should be laundered, packaged, shipped, and stored in a manner that minimizes exposure to environmental contaminants.",

        "abstract": "Public health has considerable capacity to reduce the drag of health spending on our nation by preventing the leading causes of disease, death, and disability with cost-efficient, population-based interventions and innovative, boundary-spanning approaches that link clinical care and community prevention. Public health is uniquely able to identify the burdens of disease and analyze the best strategies for addressing them. A 3-pronged strategy can help assure the value needed from our public health investments. First, we must center our efforts on prevention. Second, we must optimize our public health investments to achieve the greatest value for our investment. Third, public health must collaborate with traditional and new partners on initiatives and in funding. How we finance public health is critical to maximizing public health's benefits and requires thoughtful analysis of how federal funding affects state and local health agencies' programming and how allocation drives choices and design, among other topics, as discussed in this special issue of the journal.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: We determined the demographic and HIV test characteristics of tests conducted in CDC-funded sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics with provision of test results and posttest counseling. METHODS: We used CDC's HIV Counseling and Testing System data from 2007 for the 24 U.S. health departments that reported test-level data from STD clinics. We calculated and analyzed newly identified HIV positivity and the percentage of tests with provision of test results and posttest counseling (provision of posttest counseling), by demographic and HIV-related characteristics. RESULTS: Of 372,757 tests conducted among people without a previous HIV diagnosis by self-report, provision of posttest counseling was documented for 191,582 (51.4%) HIV tests overall and 1,922 (71.2%) newly identified HIV-positive test results. At these STD clinics, provision of posttest counseling varied by HIV serostatus, age, race/ethnicity, test type, and risk category; however, documentation of posttest counseling was missing for more than 20% of tests. The newly identified HIV positivity among all testers was 0.7%. CONCLUSIONS: One of the main goals of HIV counseling and testing is to inform people of their HIV status, because knowledge of one's HIV-positive serostatus can result in a reduction in risk behaviors and allow the person to access HIV medical care and treatment. STD clinics offering HIV testing may need to further their emphasis on increasing the proportion of clients who are provided posttest counseling and on improving documentation of this information.",

STUDY DESIGN: We performed a retrospective study of all pharmaceutical exposures involving children <7 years old reported to the US National Poison Data System from 2000 to 2008 for which the reason for exposure was coded as ‘‘malicious.’’ RESULTS: A total of 1439 cases met inclusion criteria. The mean number of cases per year was 160 (range, 124 to 189) that showed an increase over time. The median (IQR) age was 2 (1.5) years. Outcome data were available for 1244 (86.4%) patients. Of these exposures, 172 resulted in moderate or major outcomes or death. 9.7% of cases involved >1 exposed substance. The most common reported major pharmaceutical categories were analgesics, stimulants/street drugs, sedatives/hypnotics/antipsychotics, cough and cold preparations, and ethanol. In 51% of cases there was an exposure to at least one sedating agent. There were 18 (1.2%) deaths. Of these, 17 (94%) were exposed to sedating agents, including antihistamines (8 cases) and opioids (8 cases). CONCLUSIONS: Malicious administration of pharmaceuticals should be considered an important form of child abuse.",

Project START was evaluated with 522 young men aged 18-29 years released from eight prisons located in California, Mississippi, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin. Cost data were collected prospectively. Costs per participant were $689 for the single-session comparison intervention, and ranged from $1,823 to 1,836 for the Project START multi-session intervention. From the incremental threshold analysis, the multi-session intervention would be cost-effective if it prevented one HIV transmission for every 753 participants compared to the single-session intervention. Costs are comparable with other HIV prevention programs. Program managers can use these data to gauge costs of initiating these HIV prevention programs in correctional facilities.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To estimate the incidence of influenza-virus-associated severe pneumonia among Salvadorian children aged < 5 years. METHODS: Data on children aged < 5 years admitted with severe pneumonia to a sentinel hospital in the western region were collected weekly. Nasal and oropharyngeal swab specimens were collected from a convenience sample of case patients for respiratory virus testing. A health-care utilization survey was conducted in the hospital catchment area to determine the proportion of residents who sought care at the hospital. The incidence of influenza-virus-associated severe pneumonia among all Salvadorian children aged < 5 years was estimated from surveillance and census data, with adjustment for health-care utilization. Influenza virus strains were characterized by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to determine their correspondence with northern and southern hemisphere influenza vaccine formulations. FINDINGS: Physicians identified 2554 cases of severe pneumonia. Samples from 608 cases were tested for respiratory viruses and 37 (6%) were positive for influenza virus. The estimated incidence of influenza-virus-associated severe pneumonia was 3.2 cases per 1000 person-years (95% confidence interval, CI: 2.8-3.7) overall, 1.5 cases per 1000 person-years (95% CI: 1.0-2.0) during 2008, 7.6 cases per 1000 person-years (95% CI: 6.5-8.9) during 2009 and 0.6 cases per 1000 person-years (95% CI: 0.3-1.0) during 2010. Northern and southern hemisphere vaccine formulations matched influenza virus strains isolated during 2008 and 2010. CONCLUSION: Influenza-virus-associated severe pneumonia occurred frequently among young Salvadorian children during 2008-2010. Antigens in northern and southern hemisphere influenza vaccine formulations corresponded to circulating strains.",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of migration and choice of denominator on the prevalence of CP. METHOD: Data from the Metropolitan Atlanta Developmental Disabilities Surveillance Program and census and birth certificate files were used to calculate various CP prevalence estimates for 2000. RESULTS: The overall CP period prevalence was 3.2 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.7-3.8) per 1000 8-year-olds and was similar for those born in Atlanta who resided there at age 8 years (3.3; 95% CI 2.7-4.1) and those born outside Atlanta who moved into Atlanta by age 8 years (3.0; 95% CI 2.3-3.9). CP prevalence in these two migration strata was similar by sex and race/ethnicity. CP birth prevalence of 8-year-olds in Atlanta in 2000 was 2.0 (95% CI 1.6-2.5) per 1000 live births in 1992. INTERPRETATION: The authors found no evidence to support the hypothesis that differential in-migration explained higher period than birth prevalence of CP in Atlanta. Comparability of CP prevalence across geographic areas will be enhanced if future studies report both period and birth prevalence.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Intrauterine device (IUD) insertion during menses may be viewed as preferable by some providers, as it provides reassurance that the woman is not pregnant. However, this practice may result in unnecessary inconvenience and cost to women. The objective of this systematic review is to evaluate the evidence for the effect of inserting IUDs on different days of the menstrual cycle on contraceptive continuation, effectiveness and safety. STUDY DESIGN: We searched the MEDLINE database for peer-reviewed articles published in any language from database inception through March 2012 concerning the effect of inserting copper IUDs (Cu-IUD) or levonorgestrel-releasing IUDs (LNG-IUDs) on different days of the menstrual cycle on contraceptive continuation, effectiveness, and safety. The quality of each individual piece of evidence was assessed using the United States Preventive Services Task Force grading system. RESULTS: We identified eight articles that met the criteria for review. Each study examined the Cu-IUD; no studies were identified that examined the LNG-IUD. Overall, these studies suggest that timing of Cu-IUD insertion has little effect on longer term outcomes (rates of continuation, removal, expulsion, or pregnancy) or on shorter term outcomes (pain at insertion, bleeding at insertion, immediate expulsion). Specifically, there was no evidence to suggest that outcomes were better when Cu-IUD insertions were performed during menses. Limitations of the studies include small sample sizes for insertions performed during later days of the menstrual cycle and non-randomized assignment to timing of insertion. CONCLUSIONS: There is fair evidence (body of evidence grading: II-2, fair) indicating that timing of Cu-IUD insertion has little effect on contraceptive continuation, effectiveness or safety.",

        "abstract": "Public health data indicate that the global burden of breast cancer in women, measured by incidence, mortality, and economic costs, is substantial and on the increase. Worldwide, it is estimated that more than one million women are diagnosed with breast cancer every year, and more than 410,000 will die from the disease. In low- and middle-income countries (LMCs), the infrastructure and resources for routine screening mammography are often unavailable. In such lower resource settings, breast cancers are commonly diagnosed at late stages, and women may receive inadequate treatment, pain relief, or palliative care. There have been an increasing number of global health initiatives to address breast cancer including efforts by Susan G. Komen for the Cure((c)), the Breast Health Global Initiative (BHGI), the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the American Cancer Society, the National Cancer Institute (NCI), and ongoing work by leading oncology societies in different parts of the world. To support such initiatives, and to provide a scientific evidence base for health policy and public health decision making, there is a need for further health services research and program evaluations. Cancer registries can be invaluable in ascertaining the magnitude of cancer disease burden and its distribution in these countries. Additional data are needed for various geographic areas to assess resources required, cost-effectiveness, and humane approaches for preventing or controlling breast cancer in low resource settings in developing countries.",

        "abstract": "Cats and their fleas collected in Guatemala were investigated for the presence of Bartonella infections. Bartonella bacteria were cultured from 8.2% (13/159) of cats, and all cultures were identified as B. henselae. Molecular analysis allowed detection of Bartonella DNA in 33.8% (48/142) of cats and in 22.4% (34/152) of cat fleas using gltA, nuoG, and 16S-23S internal transcribed spacer targets. Two Bartonella species, B. henselae and B. clarridgeiae, were identified in cats and cat fleas by molecular analysis, with B. henselae being more common than B. clarridgeiae in the cats (68.1%; 32/47 vs 31.9%; 15/47). The nuoG was found to be less sensitive for detecting B. clarridgeiae compared with other molecular targets and could detect only two of the 15 B. clarridgeiae-infected cats. No significant differences were observed for prevalence between male and female cats and between different age groups. No evident association was observed between the presence of Bartonella species in cats and in their fleas.",

        "abstract": "SETTING: In the Philippines, programmatic treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) was initiated by the Tropical Disease Foundation in 1999 and transitioned to the National TB Program in 2006. OBJECTIVE: To determine patient and socio-demographic characteristics associated with default, and the impact of patient support measures on default. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort analysis of 583 MDR-TB patients treated from 1999 to 2006. RESULTS: A total of 88 (15%) patients defaulted from treatment. The median follow-up time for patients who defaulted was 289 days (range 1-846). In multivariate analysis adjusted for age, sex and previous TB treatment, receiving a greater number of treatment drugs (>/=5 vs. 2-3 drugs, HR 7.2, 95%CI 3.3-16.0, P < 0.001) was significantly associated with an increased risk of default, while decentralization reduced the risk of default (HR 0.3, 95%CI 0.2-0.7, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Improving access to treatment for MDR-TB through decentralization of care to centers near the patient's residence reduced the risk of default. Further research is needed to evaluate the feasibility, impact and cost-effectiveness of decentralized care models for MDR-TB treatment.",

        "abstract": "Nonsyndromic atrioventricular septal defects (AVSDs) are serious congenital heart defects for which information on prevalence and descriptive characteristics based on large, geographically, and ethnically diverse populations has been limited. To describe the birth prevalence and phenotype of nonsyndromic AVSDs, we used data from the National Birth Defects Prevention Study (NBDPS), a multisite, population-based case-control study aimed at identifying genetic and environmental risk factors for birth defects. For this analysis, infants born during the period 1997-2005 and meeting the NBDPS case definition for AVSDs were included. Infants with an AVSD associated with recognized or strongly suspected chromosomal abnormalities or single-gene disorders (syndromic case infants) were excluded. We identified 302 infants with a nonsyndromic AVSD for a birth prevalence of 0.83/10,000 livebirths. Over 20% of infants with an AVSD had an additional major birth defect, with gastrointestinal, renal or urinary, and central nervous system defects being the most common. A lower prevalence of AVSDs was seen among infants born to Hispanic mothers compared with those born to non-Hispanic White mothers [prevalence ratio = 0.63 (95% confidence interval: 0.46-0.86)]. Understanding the prevalence of nonsyndromic AVSDs, demographic factors associated with their occurrence, and associated defects could help guide clinical care, as well as contribute to a better understanding of pathogenesis.

        "abstract": "An estimated 499 million curable sexually transmitted infections (STIs; gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, and trichomoniasis) occurred globally in 2008. In addition, well over 500 million people are estimated to have a viral STI such as herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) or human papillomavirus (HPV) at any point in time. STIs result in a large global burden of sexual, reproductive, and maternal-child health consequences, including genital symptoms, pregnancy complications, cancer, infertility, and enhanced HIV transmission, as well as important psychosocial consequences and financial costs. STI control strategies based primarily on behavioral primary prevention and STI case management have had clear successes, but gains have not been universal. Current STI control is hampered or threatened by several behavioral, biological, and implementation challenges, including a large proportion of asymptomatic infections, lack of feasible diagnostic tests globally, antimicrobial resistance, repeat infections, and barriers to intervention access, availability, and scale-up. Vaccines against HPV and hepatitis B virus offer a new paradigm for STI control. Challenges to existing STI prevention efforts provide important reasons for working toward additional STI vaccines. We summarize the global epidemiology of STIs and STI-associated complications, examine challenges to existing STI prevention efforts, and discuss the need for new STI vaccines for future prevention efforts.",

METHODS: Analysis of nationally representative data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) II, III, and 1999-2004; 12 384 US children and adolescents ages 2 to 19 years were included in the analysis. Outcome measures were the proportion of subjects with severe and morbid obesity, with age, gender, race, and poverty-income ratio (PIR) as key variables. RESULTS: In 1999-2004, 3.8% of children 2 to 19 years old had a BMI in the > or = 99th percentile, with higher prevalence among boys than girls (4.6% vs 2.9%; P < .001). Prevalence was highest among blacks, 5.7% and Mexican Americans, 5.2%, compared with whites, 3.1% (P < .001). The prevalence differed by the PIR category as well (4.3% for those with PIR < or = 3 vs 2.5% for those with PIR>3; P=.002). BMI > or = 40kg/m(2) was found in 1.3% of adolescents ages 12 to 19 years, with similar associations with race and poverty. The overall prevalence of BMI > or = 99th percentile has increased by more than 300% since NHANES II (1976), and over 70% since NHANES III (1994) in children 2 to 19 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: Rates of severe childhood obesity have tripled in the last 25 years, with significant differences by race, gender, and poverty. This places demands on health care and community services, especially because the highest rates are among children who are frequently underserved by the health care system.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Meningococcal disease incidence in the U.S. is at an all-time low. In a previous study of Georgia high school students, meningococcal carriage prevalence was 7%. The purpose of this study was to measure the impact of a meningococcal conjugate vaccine on serogroup Y meningococcal carriage and to define the dynamics of carriage in high school students. METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study at 8 high schools, 4 each in Maryland and Georgia during a school year. In each state, 2 high schools were randomized for participating students to receive MCV4-DT at the beginning of the study and 2 at the end. Oropharyngeal swab cultures for meningococcal carriage were performed three times during the school year. RESULTS: Among 3,311 students, prevalence of meningococcal carriage was 3.21%- 4.01%. Phenotypically non-groupable strains accounted for 88% of carriage isolates. There were only 5 observed acquisitions of serogroup Y strains during the study; therefore, the impact of MCV4-DT on meningococcal carriage could not be determined. CONCLUSIONS: Meningococcal carriage rates in U.S. high school students were lower than expected and the vast majority of strains did not express capsule. These findings may help explain the historically low incidence of meningococcal disease in the U.S.",

        "abstract": "Mental health disparities have received increased attention in the literature in recent years. After considering 165 different health disparity conditions, the Federal Collaborative for Health Disparities Research chose mental health disparity as one of four topics warranting its immediate national research attention. In this essay, we describe the challenges and opportunities encountered in developing a research agenda to address mental health disparities in the United States. Varying definitions of mental health disparity, the heterogeneity of populations facing such disparity, and the power, complexity, and intertwined nature of contributing factors are among the many challenges. We convey an evolving interagency approach to mental health disparities research and guidance for further work in the field.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Seasonal influenza is responsible for more than 200,000 hospitalizations each year in the United States. Although hospital-onset (HO) influenza contributes to morbidity and mortality among these patients, little is known about its overall epidemiology. OBJECTIVE: We describe patients with HO influenza in the United States during the 2010-2011 influenza season and compare them with community-onset (CO) cases to better understand factors associated with illness. METHODS: We identified laboratory-confirmed, influenza-related hospitalizations using the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-NET), a network that conducts population-based surveillance in 16 states. CO cases had laboratory confirmation </= 3 days after hospital admission; HO cases had laboratory confirmation > 3 days after admission. RESULTS: We identified 172 (2.8%) HO cases among a total of 6,171 influenza-positive hospitalizations. HO and CO cases did not differ by age (P = .22), sex (P = .29), or race (P = .25). Chronic medical conditions were more common in HO cases (89%) compared with CO cases (78%) (P < .01), and a greater proportion of HO cases (42%) than CO cases (17%) were admitted to the intensive care unit (P < .01). The median length of stay after influenza diagnosis of HO cases (7.5 days) was greater than that of CO cases (3 days) (P < .01). CONCLUSION: HO cases had greater length of stay and were more likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit or die compared with CO cases. HO influenza may play a role in the clinical outcome of hospitalized patients, particularly among those with chronic medical conditions.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Underage drinking, particularly binge drinking, is an important public health problem that results in substantial premature mortality and morbidity. Little is known about the potential influence of the alcohol-use behaviors of adults on youth alcohol use at a population level. The purpose of this study was to examine the correlation of alcohol-use behaviors among youth with those of adults at a population level. METHODS: Data were analyzed in 2007 and 2008, using biennial 1993-2005 data from state school-based Youth Risk Behavior Surveys of students in grades 9-12, and from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System for adults aged >or=18 years. Pearson correlation coefficients (r) were used to compare state prevalence estimates for youth with those of adults for several alcohol-use measures. RESULTS: Overall and subgroup-specific state youth estimates of current drinking and binge drinking were generally moderately to strongly correlated with adult alcohol use (range of r -values for pooled estimates across all years: 0.35-0.68 for current drinking [p<0.01 for all correlations]; 0.24-0.60 for binge drinking [p<0.01 for all correlations]) and with youth and adult drinking-and-driving behaviors (range of r-values for pooled estimates: 0.12-0.52, p<0.01 for all but one correlation). Correlation coefficients were generally higher for girls with women and for youth with younger adults aged 18-34 years. The use of alcohol by youth before they were aged 13 years was not correlated with adult alcohol-use measures, and most youth alcohol-use measures were not correlated with adult heavy-alcohol use. CONCLUSIONS: Most state youth alcohol-use estimates were correlated with state adult estimates. These findings have implications for underage-drinking control strategies and suggest that efforts to address this problem need to be targeted on a broader societal level.",

        "abstract": "Adults with obesity are less likely than adults without obesity to follow physical activity recommendations, despite the known benefits of physical activity for weight loss and weight maintenance (1,2). Arthritis is a common comorbidity of adults with obesity (3), and arthritis-related joint pain and functional limitation might contribute substantially to low rates of physical activity among adults with obesity. CDC analyzed combined 2007 and 2009 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data for adults aged ≥18 years to estimate overall and state-specific prevalence of 1) self-reported doctor-diagnosed arthritis among adults with self-reported obesity, and 2) prevalence of self-reported physical inactivity among adults with obesity by arthritis status. This report describes the results of that analysis, which indicted that, overall, arthritis affected 35.6% of adults with obesity. After adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and education level, adults with obesity and arthritis were 44% more likely to be physically inactive compared with persons with obesity but without arthritis. Among states, the median prevalence of arthritis among adults with obesity was 35.6%. In every state/area except Guam, the prevalence of physical inactivity among adults with obesity was at least 5 percentage points higher (range: 5.4--15.9 percentage points) among persons with arthritis than those without arthritis. Arthritis might be a special barrier to increasing physical activity among many adults with obesity. Safe and effective self-management education and physical activity programs for adults with arthritis exist to address this barrier, are offered in many communities, and can help adults with obesity and arthritis become more physically active.",

        "abstract": "AIMS: Intimate partner violence (IPV) during pregnancy increases women's risk of pregnancy complications and adverse birth outcomes. The goal of this study was to examine the association between IPV and prenatal trauma and placental abruption during pregnancy. METHODS: Prenatal and hospital obstetrical charts were reviewed for 2873 women who gave birth between January 2000 and March 2002 in a Northeastern city. We examined associations among sociodemographic characteristics, health-related variables, IPV, and pregnancy trauma and placental abruption using univariate and multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Of the 2873 women in the analyses, 105 (3.7%) reported IPV during prenatal care. After controlling for sociodemographic variables; tobacco, alcohol, and drug use; preeclampsia; and gestational diabetes during pregnancy, women who reported IPV also had higher odds of pregnancy trauma and placental abruption (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 32.08, 95% confidence interval [CI] 14.33-71.80, p < 0.01, and OR 5.17, 95% CI 1.37-19.51, p < 0.05, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: This study found that IPV is a significant and independent risk factor for pregnancy trauma and placental abruption after controlling for factors typically associated with these outcomes. This study has implications for partner violence screening and intervention policies among pregnant women and highlights the importance of making distinctions about the type of IPV that women experience.",

In support of the Decision Scheme, CDC developed educational resources for emergency medical service (EMS) professionals, one of CDC's first efforts to develop and broadly disseminate educational information for the EMS community. CDC wanted to systematically collect information from the EMS community on what worked and what did not with respect to these educational materials and which materials were of most use. An evaluation was conducted to obtain feedback from EMS professionals about the Decision Scheme and use of Decision Scheme educational materials. The evaluation included a survey and a series of focus groups. Findings indicate that a segment of the Decision Scheme's intended audience is using the materials and learning from them, and they have had a positive influence on their triage practices. However, many of the individuals who participated in this research are not using the Decision Scheme and indicated that the materials have not affected their triage practices. Findings presented in this article can be used to inform development and distribution of additional Decision Scheme educational resources to ensure they reach a greater proportion of EMS professionals and to inform other education and dissemination efforts with the EMS community.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To examine the associations of upward crossing of major percentiles in weight-for-length in the first 24 months of life with the prevalence of obesity at ages 5 and 10 years. DESIGN: Longitudinal study. SETTING: Multisite clinical practice. PARTICIPANTS: We included 44,622 children aged from 1 month to less than 11 years with 122,214 length/height and weight measurements from January 1, 1980, through December 31, 2008. MAIN EXPOSURE: The number of major weight-for-length percentiles crossed during each of four 6-month intervals, that is, 1 to 6 months, 6 to 12 months, 12 to 18 months, and 18 to 24 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Odds and observed prevalence of obesity (body mass index [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared] >/=95th percentile) at ages 5 and 10 years. RESULTS: Crossing upwards 2 or more weight-for-length percentiles was common in the first 6 months of life (43%) and less common during later age intervals. Crossing upwards 2 or more weight-for-length percentiles in the first 24 months was associated with elevated odds of obesity at ages 5 years (odds ratio, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.84-2.34) and 10 years (1.75; 1.53-2.00) compared with crossing less than 2 major percentiles. Obesity prevalence at ages 5 and 10 was highest among children who crossed upwards 2 or more weight-for-length percentiles in the first 6 months of life. CONCLUSIONS: Crossing upwards 2 or more major weight-for-length percentiles in the first 24 months of life is associated with later obesity. Upward crossing of 2 weight-for-length percentiles in the first 6 months is associated with the highest prevalence of obesity 5 and 10 years later. Efforts to curb excess weight gain in infancy may be useful in preventing later obesity.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Children with sickle cell disease (SCD) are at increased risk of illness and death from invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). The introduction in 2000 of the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) and penicillin prophylaxis for children with SCD has greatly reduced the incidence of IPD in this population. However, a recent report suggested an increase in cases of IPD in children with SCD. METHODS: Using data from Active Bacterial Core Surveillance (ABCs), we analyzed trends in hospitalizations, mortality, and serotype among children with SCD compared with other children. We used neonatal screening data to estimate SCD population denominators for each ABCs site. RESULTS: From 1998-2009, 3,069 cases of IPD occurred among African-American children less than 18 years of age in the ABCs catchment area. Of these, 127 (4.1%) had SCD identified by medical chart review and 185 (6.0%) had one or more IPD risk factors, excluding SCD. Rates of IPD among children with SCD declined by 53% (1,118 versus 530 per 100,000) while the overall rates among African-American children declined by 74% (54 to 14 per 100,000). For all time periods, children with SCD and IPD were more likely to be hospitalized (84%-92% versus 31%-56%) and more likely to die (6%-17% versus 1%-2%) than children with no risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: While the rate of IPD in children with SCD has dropped dramatically since PCV7 introduction, the rate of IPD in children with SCD remains higher than that of the general population of African-American children, pointing to the need for more effective prevention efforts to prevent IPD in children with SCD.",

        "abstract": "The federal ban in the United States on the sale of turtles with shell lengths <4 inches that was established in 1975 has reduced the number of turtle-associated human Salmonella infections during subsequent years, especially among children. Although numerous sporadic turtle-associated Salmonella infections in humans have been reported since the ban went into effect, outbreaks were not reported until recently. Since 2006, 3 multistate outbreaks of turtle-associated Salmonella infections have been documented in the United States. This review examines the history of turtle-associated human Salmonella infections in the United States and discusses reasons why an increase in turtle-associated salmonellosis may be occurring and how challenges in enforcement of the ban affect disease control. Additional steps should be considered by the public health community, state governments, and enforcement agencies to prevent turtle-associated Salmonella infections in humans.",

        "abstract": "A simplified lateral flow assay for the detection of antibodies to HIV using magnetic bead conjugates and multi-branched peptides from both HIV-1 and HIV-2 was developed. Magnetic immunochromatography testing (MICT) uses a standard lateral-flow platform that incorporates magnetic bead conjugates for quantitative measurement of the magnetic field distortion associated with the bound magnetic conjugate (reported as adjusted magnetic units, MAR). The results of the optimized MICT assay were compared to standard enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and Western blot (WB) results using a blinded 649-member panel of specimens from the US, Cameroon, and West Africa. The panel was comprised of samples from individuals infected with various HIV-1 subtypes (n=234), HIV-2 (n=65) and HIV-seronegative specimens (n=350). Additionally, thirteen HIV-1 sero-conversion panels (total specimens=85), a worldwide panel containing seven of the major circulating HIV-1 subtypes (n=18), an HIV-2 panel, an HIV-1/HIV-2 mixed panel, and 100 prospective specimens were tested with completely concordant results. Assay reproducibility (observed MAR) for both intra- and inter-run testing was excellent with coefficients of variation <12%. MICT can provide a rapid, low-cost method of determining HIV antibody status requiring no subjective interpretations.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: In this study, we build on the previous findings of increased diabetes prevalence among American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) young adults, by studying the rate at which annual prevalence estimates of diagnosed diabetes increased from 1994 to 2007. DESIGN AND SETTING: For this study, BRFSS data for 1994-2007 from the 50 states, District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands were analyzed. PARTICIPANTS: Only non-institutionalized adults aged 18 years and older were eligible to participate in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: To examine the existence and strength of a trend, we analyzed plots and Spearman's rank correlation coefficients of annual prevalence estimates for each group of young adults. Mantel-Haenszel tests were employed to study the relationship of diagnosed diabetes prevalence and race (AI/ AN, non-Hispanic White), while controlling for the time periods 1994-2000 and 2001-2007. To quantify increases in the disparity of diagnosed diabetes prevalence and race (AI/ AN, non-Hispanic White), odds risk ratio estimates were employed to approximate corresponding prevalence ratio estimates for the time periods 1994-2000 and 2001-2007. RESULTS: Employing Spearman's test for trend resulted in observing, during 1994-2007, statistically significant increasing trends in the annual prevalence estimates of diagnosed diabetes among AI/AN and non-Hispanic White young adults. AI/AN young adults, on average, were 1.7 (95% CI; [1.12, 2.63]) times more likely than non-Hispanic White young adults to be diagnosed with diabetes during 1994-2000 and 2.5 (95% CI; [1.93, 3.32]) times more likely during 2001-2007. CONCLUSION: The findings in this study suggests that the disparity in the estimated prevalence of diagnosed diabetes between AI/AN and NHW young adults widened steadily from 2001 to 2007.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Physical activity in childhood has many health benefits; however, the majority of children in many countries including Mexico are insufficiently active. The objective of this investigation was to test the impact of a school-based environmental intervention on the physical activity and physical fitness of students attending public primary schools in Mexico City. METHODS: Twenty-seven schools were randomly assigned to basic or plus intervention or control. The basic and plus groups were exposed to school environment and policy changes to enhance physical activity. Physical activity was evaluated in 699 randomly selected 4 and 5 grade students by measuring school-day and all-day (24-hour) steps using pedometers worn for five days before and after the 6-month intervention. Physical fitness was assessed by measuring the 9-minute run, flexibility, and sit-ups. We calculated the average change in school-day and all-day steps and fitness measures from baseline to follow-up. Using linear regression, we tested the effect of intervention on change controlling for baseline measures and covariates and accounting for the design effect of school. Using logistic regression, we tested the effect of intervention on reaching step cut-offs at baseline and follow-up. RESULTS: The plus group significantly (p<0.05) increased school-day steps relative to control (change=687 v -639). Significantly (p<0.05) more participants in basic (25.8%) and plus (36.4%) groups reached step cut-offs during school relative to control (12.0%). The basic group significantly (p< 0.05) increased all-day steps (change=581) relative to control (change=581 v -419). The plus group significantly (p=0.05) increased sit-ups relative to control (change=0.3 v -1.7). CONCLUSION: A school-based environmental intervention improved student physical activity during school in public schools in Mexico City.",

Mean BAR decreased across increasing waist tertiles among men, but not women, and this association was stronger among officers who consumed more alcohol. Larger waist circumference may be associated with lower BAR, providing an opportunity for intervention prior to disease development.",

        "abstract": "SETTING: The United States (US) National Tuberculosis Surveillance System (NTSS), including 50 states, District of Columbia, and New York City. OBJECTIVE: To examine disparities in characteristics and rates of Asian/Pacific Islander (API) and non-Hispanic White tuberculosis (TB) patients. DESIGN: Descriptive analysis and logistic regression of selected 1993-2006 NTSS data. US Census Bureau Zip Code Tabulation Areas and geographic information system were used to compare API and non-Hispanic White TB patients by population density. RESULT: Of 253299 TB cases, 1.9.8% were APIs and 23.2% were Whites; 94.2% APIs and 11.9% Whites were foreign-born. Factors that were most often associated with APIs were being female, age 15-24 years, extrapulmonary TB, and drug resistance. APIs were less likely than Whites to be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive, homeless, substance abusers, or on directly observed therapy. From 1993 to 2006, the API TB case rate declined by 42.9% vs. 66.6% in Whites (P < 0.01). Being foreign-born was the strongest risk factor for TB, regardless of population densities, but APIs were more likely to have TB than foreign-born Whites at lower population densities. CONCLUSION: Disparities in TB exist among US APIs and non-Hispanic Whites. TB program officials should allocate programs appropriately for foreign-born APIs in lower population density areas.",

        "abstract": "Globally, norovirus is associated with approximately one-fifth of all diarrhea cases, with similar prevalence in both children and adults, and is estimated to cause over 200,000 deaths annually in developing countries. Norovirus is an important pathogen in a number of high-priority domains: it is the most common cause of diarrheal episodes globally, the principal cause of foodborne disease outbreaks in the United States, a key health care-acquired infection, a common cause of travel-associated diarrhea, and a bane for deployed military troops. Partly as a result of this ubiquity and burden across a range of different populations, identifying target groups and strategies for intervention has been challenging. And, on top of the breadth of this public health problem, there remain important gaps in scientific knowledge regarding norovirus, especially with respect to disease in low-income settings. Many pathogens can cause acute gastroenteritis. Historically, rotavirus was the most common cause of severe disease in young children globally. Now, vaccines are available for rotavirus and are universally recommended by the World Health Organization. In countries with effective rotavirus vaccination programs, disease due to that pathogen has decreased markedly, but norovirus persists and is now the most common cause of pediatric gastroenteritis requiring medical attention. However, the data supporting the precise role of norovirus in low- and middle-income settings are sparse. With vaccines in the pipeline, addressing these and other important knowledge gaps is increasingly pressing. We assembled an expert group to assess the evidence for the global burden of norovirus and to consider the prospects for norovirus vaccine development. The group assessed the evidence in the areas of burden of disease, epidemiology, diagnostics, disease attribution, acquired immunity, and innate susceptibility, and the group considered how to bring norovirus vaccines from their current state of development to a viable product that will benefit global health.",

        "abstract": "Recent efforts to address concerns about microbial contamination of food plants and resulting foodborne illness have prompted new collaboration and interactions between the scientific communities of plant pathology and food safety. This article provides perspectives from scientists of both disciplines and presents selected research results and concepts that highlight existing and possible future synergisms for audiences of both disciplines. Plant pathology is a complex discipline that encompasses studies of the dissemination, colonization, and infection of plants by microbes such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and oomycetes. Plant pathologists study plant diseases as well as host plant defense responses and disease management strategies with the goal of minimizing disease occurrences and impacts. Repeated outbreaks of human illness attributed to the contamination of fresh produce, nuts and seeds, and other plant-derived foods by human enteric pathogens such as Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp. have led some plant pathologists to broaden the application of their science in the past two decades, to address problems of human pathogens on plants (HPOPs). Food microbiology, which began with the study of microbes that spoil foods and those that are critical to produce food, now also focuses study on how foods become contaminated with pathogens and how this can be controlled or prevented. Thus, at the same time, public health researchers and food microbiologists have become more concerned about plant-microbe interactions before and after harvest. New collaborations are forming between members of the plant pathology and food safety communities, leading to enhanced research capacity and greater understanding of the issues for which research is needed. The two communities use somewhat different vocabularies and conceptual models. For example, traditional plant pathology concepts such as the disease triangle and the disease cycle can help to define cross-over issues that pertain also to HPOP research, and can suggest logical strategies for minimizing the risk of microbial contamination. Continued interactions and communication among these two disciplinary communities is essential and can be achieved by the creation of an interdisciplinary research coordination network. We hope that this article, an introduction to the multidisciplinary HPOP arena, will be useful to researchers in many related fields.",

We assessed the efficiency of these units and access to vaccines among ethnic groups. An average of 251 persons per hour (SE 65) were vaccinated at the PODs; a 10% increase in use of live-attenuated monovalent vaccines reduced that rate by 23 persons per hour (SE 7). Vaccination rates were highest for Asians (257/10,000 persons), followed by Hispanics (114/10,000), whites (75/100,000), and African Americans (37/10,000). Average distance traveled to a POD was highest for whites (6.6 miles; SD 6.5) and lowest for Hispanics (4.7 miles; SD +/-5.3). Placing PODs in areas of high population density could be an effective strategy to reach large numbers of persons for mass vaccination, but additional PODs may be needed to improve coverage for specific populations.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Integrating mental health with general medical care can increase access to mental health services, but requires helping generalists acquire a range of unfamiliar knowledge and master potentially complex diagnostic and treatment processes. METHOD: We describe a model for integrating complex specialty care with generalist/primary care, using as an illustration the integration of mental health into hospital-based HIV treatment services in Ethiopia. Generalists and specialists collaboratively developed mental health treatments to fit the knowledge, skills and resources of the generalists. The model recognizes commonalities between mental health and general medical care, focusing on practical interventions acceptable to patients. It was developed through a process of literature review, interviews, observing clinical practice, pilot trainings and expert consultation. Preliminary evaluation results were obtained by debriefing generalist trainees after their return to their clinical sites. RESULTS: In planning interviews, generalists reported discomfort making mental health diagnoses but recognition of symptom groups including low mood, anxiety, thought problems, poor child behaviour, seizures and substance use. Diagnostic and treatment algorithms were developed for these groups and tailored to the setting by including possible medical causes and burdens of living with HIV. First-line treatment included modalities familiar to generalists: empathetic patient-provider interactions, psychoeducation, cognitive reframing, referral to community supports and elements of symptom-specific evidence-informed counselling. Training introduced basic skills, with evolving expertise supported by job aides and ongoing support from mental health nurses cross-trained in HIV testing. Feedback from trainees suggested the programme fit well with generalists' settings and clinical goals. CONCLUSIONS: An integration model based on collaboratively developing processes that fit the generalist setting shows promise as a method for incorporating complex, multi-faceted interventions into general medical settings. Formal evaluations will be needed to compare the quality of care provided with more traditional approaches and to determine the resources required to sustain quality over time.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There are few validated models for prediction of in-hospital mortality after ischemic stroke. We used Get With the Guidelines-Stroke Program data to derive and validate prediction models for a patient's risk of in-hospital ischemic stroke mortality. METHODS AND RESULTS: Between October 2001 and December 2007, there were 1036 hospitals that contributed 274 988 ischemic stroke patients to this study. The sample was randomly divided into a derivation (60%) and validation (40%) sample. Logistic regression was used to determine the independent predictors of mortality and to assign point scores for a prediction model. We also separately derived and validated a model in the 109 187 patients (39.7%) with a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score recorded. Model discrimination was quantified by calculating the C statistic from the validation sample. In-hospital mortality was 5.5% overall and 5.2% in the subset in which NIHSS score was recorded. Characteristics associated with in-hospital mortality were age, arrival mode (eg, via ambulance versus other mode), history of atrial fibrillation, previous stroke, previous myocardial infarction, carotid stenosis, diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, hypertension, history of dyslipidemia, current smoking, and weekend or night admission. The C statistic was 0.72 in the overall validation sample and 0.85 in the model that included NIHSS score. A model with NIHSS score alone provided nearly as good discrimination (C statistic 0.83). Plots of observed versus predicted mortality showed excellent model calibration in the validation sample. CONCLUSIONS: The Get With the Guidelines-Stroke risk model provides clinicians with a well-validated, practical bedside tool for mortality risk stratification. The NIHSS score provides substantial incremental information on a patient's short-term mortality risk and is the strongest predictor of mortality.",

        "abstract": "In eukaryotic cells, secretory pathway proteins must pass stringent quality control checkpoints before exiting the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Acquisition of native structure is generally considered to be the most important prerequisite for ER exit. However, structurally detailed protein folding studies in the ER are few. Furthermore, aberrant ER quality control decisions are associated with a large and increasing number of human diseases, highlighting the need for more detailed studies on the molecular determinants that result in proteins being either secreted or retained. Here we used the clonotypic chains of the T cell receptor (TCR) as a model to analyze lumenal determinants of ER quality control with a particular emphasis on how proper assembly of oligomeric proteins can be monitored in the ER. A combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches allowed us to provide a detailed model for TCR assembly control in the cell. We found that folding of the TCR a chain constant domain C is dependent on heterodimerization. Furthermore, our data show that some variable regions associated with either chain can remain incompletely folded until chain pairing occurs. Together, these data argue for template-assisted folding at more than one point in the TCR / assembly process, which allows specific recognition of unassembled clonotypic chains by the ER chaperone machinery and, therefore, reliable quality control of this important immune receptor. Additionally, it highlights an unreported possible limitation in the a and chain combinations that comprise the T cell repertoire. 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",

Sputum specimens from adults with presumptive tuberculosis (TB) were homogenized and split for: (1) direct Xpert and microscopy, and (2) concentration for Xpert, microscopy, culture [Lowenstein-Jensen (LJ) solid media and Mycobacteria Growth Indicator Tube(R) (MGIT)], indirect drug susceptibility testing (DST) using the absolute concentration method and MGIT, and TB-Biochip. In total, 109 of 238 (45.8 %) specimens were culture-positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC), and, of these, 67 isolates were rifampicin resistant (RIF-R) by phenotypic DST and 64/67 (95.5 %) were isoniazid resistant (INH-R). Compared to culture of the same specimen, a single direct Xpert was more sensitive for detecting MTBC [95.3 %, 95 % confidence interval (CI), 90.0-98.3 %] than direct (59.6 %, 95 % CI, 50.2-68.5 %) or concentrated smear (85.3 %, 95 % CI, 77.7-91.1 %) or LJ culture (80.8 %, 95 % CI, 72.4-87.5 %); the specificity was 86.0 % (95 % CI, 78.9-91.3 %). Compared with MGIT DST, Xpert correctly identified 98.2 % (95 % CI, 91.5-99.9 %) of RIF-R and 95.5 % (95 % CI, 85.8-99.2 %) of RIF-susceptible (RIF-S) specimens. In a subset of 104 specimens, the sensitivity of TB-Biochip for MTBC detection compared to culture was 97.3 % (95 % CI, 91.0-99.5 %); the specificity was 78.1 % (95 % CI, 61.5-89.9 %). TB-Biochip correctly identified 100 % (95 % CI, 94.2-100 %) of RIF-R, 94.7 % (95 % CI, 76.7-99.7 %) of RIF-S, 98.2 % (95 % CI, 91.4-99.9 %) of INH-R, and 78.6 % (95 % CI, 52.1-94.2 %) of INH-S specimens compared to MGIT DST. Xpert and Biochip were similar in accuracy for detecting MTBC and RIF resistance compared to conventional culture methods.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Road traffic injuries (RTIs) are a major cause of both morbidity and mortality globally. Relative to countries with similar economic patterns both within and outside of South-East Asia, Cambodia's road traffic fatality rate is high, with motorcyclists accounting for more than half of all fatalities as a result of head injuries. Despite the initiation of national motorcycle helmet legislation for Cambodian drivers in 2009, helmet use among both drivers and passengers remains low. METHODS: This study adopted a two-pronged approach to assess the current status of and knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAPs) towards helmet use among drivers and passengers in five provinces in Cambodia. The objective was to better understand helmet use over a two year period since the introduction of the 2009 legislation. Researchers conducted both (1) direct observation of daytime and nighttime helmet use (January 2011-January 2013) and (2) roadside KAP interviews with motorcyclists (November 2010-November 2012). RESULTS: The observed helmet rate across all study sites was 33% during nighttime and 48% during daytime, with proportions up to ten times higher among drivers compared with passengers. Self-reported helmet use was higher than observed use. Within the past 30 days, 60% of respondents reported that they \"always\" wore a helmet when they were drivers while only 24% reported they \"always\" wore a helmet as a passenger. Reported barriers for use among drivers included: \"driving route\", \"forgetfulness\", and \"inconvenience/discomfort.\" CONCLUSION: Despite awareness of the protective value of helmets, motorcycle helmet use rates remain low in Cambodia. Many misconceptions remain in Cambodia regarding helmet use, including that they are unnecessary for short distance or at low speeds. These serve as an important barrier to helmet use, which, if dispelled and coupled with visible and regular enforcement, may significantly reduce the number of motorcycle-related injuries and fatalities.",

Using US mortality data for persons aged <18 years who died during 28 September 2003 to 2 October 2010, we estimated influenza-attributable deaths using a generalized linear regression model based on seasonal covariates, influenza-certified deaths (deaths for which influenza was a reported cause of death), and occurrence during the 2009 pandemic period. Of 32 783 paediatric deaths in the death categories examined, 853 (3%) were influenza-certified. The estimated number of influenza-attributable deaths over the study period was 1.8 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3-2.8] times higher than the number of influenza-certified deaths. Influenza-attributable deaths were 2.1 (95% CI 1.5-3.4) times higher than influenza-certified deaths during the non-pandemic period and 1.1 (95% CI 1.0-1.8) times higher during the pandemic. Overall, US paediatric deaths attributable to influenza were almost twice the number reported by death certificate codes in the seasons prior to the 2009 pandemic.",

METHODS: Data for up to 2623 adults aged >/=20 years with diagnosed diabetes who participated in 2-year cycles of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys from 1999 to 2008 were examined. RESULTS: The control of HbA1c (37.0% to 55.2%), blood pressure (35.2% to 51.0%), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC) (32.5% to 52.9%) improved significantly. Both men and women experienced significant improvement in HbA1c and LDLC. Whites showed significant improvement in glycemic control, LDLC control, and the control of all three risk factors; African Americans in glycemic control and blood pressure control; and Mexican Americans in glycemic control and the control of all three risk factors. Compared with whites, African Americans (prevalence ratio [PR]=0.84; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.74-0.96) and Mexican Americans (PR=0.82; 95% CI: 0.72-0.92) had worse glycemic control, and Mexican Americans had worse control of LDLC (PR=0.70, 95% CI:0.57-0.87) and of all three risk factors (PR=0.46, 95% CI:0.23-0.90). Little change occurred in the prevalence of not currently smoking, having a C-reactive protein concentration <3 g/l, and having a urinary albumin-creatinine ratio <30 mg/g. The prevalence of having a body mass index <30 kg/m(2) decreased from 45.4% to 37.6% (p(linear trend) =0.045). CONCLUSIONS: Significant improvements in recommended levels of HbA1c, blood pressure, and LDLC occurred in diabetic adults in the United States between 1999 and 2008.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: We assessed US adult smokeless tobacco (SLT) users' exposure and response to SLT health warnings, which are currently in text-only format, covering 30% of the two primary surfaces of SLT containers and 20% of advertisements. METHODS: Data were from the 2012-2013 National Adult Tobacco Survey. Past 30-day exposure to SLT health warnings among past 30-day SLT users (n=1626) was a self-report of seeing warnings on SLT packages: \"Very often,\" \"Often,\" or \"Sometimes\" (versus \"Rarely\" or \"Never\"). We measured the association between SLT health warning exposure and perceptions of SLT harmfulness and addictiveness using logistic regression. RESULTS: Of past 30-day SLT users, 77.5% reported exposure to SLT health warnings, with lower prevalence reported among females and users of novel SLT products (snus/dissolvable tobacco). Furthermore, exposure reduced linearly with reducing education and annual household income (p<0.01). Among exposed past 30-day SLT users, 73.9% reported thinking about the health risks of SLT, while 17.1% reported stopping SLT use on >/=1 occasion within the past 30days. Exposure to SLT warnings was associated with perceived SLT harmfulness (AOR=2.16; 95% CI=1.15-4.04), but not with perceived SLT addictiveness. CONCLUSION: Socioeconomic disparities found in exposure and response to SLT health warnings can be addressed through implementation of large pictorial warnings.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Eliminating malaria requires vector control interventions that dramatically reduce adult mosquito population densities and survival rates. Indoor applications of insecticidal nets and sprays are effective against an important minority of mosquito species that rely heavily upon human blood and habitations for survival. However, complementary approaches are needed to tackle a broader diversity of less human-specialized vectors by killing them at other resource targets. METHODS: Impacts of strategies that target insecticides to humans or animals can be rationalized in terms of biological coverage of blood resources, quantified as proportional coverage of all blood resources mosquito vectors utilize. Here, this concept is adapted to enable impact prediction for diverse vector control strategies based on measurements of utilization rates for any definable, targetable resource subset, even if that overall resource is not quantifiable. RESULTS: The usefulness of this approach is illustrated by deriving utilization rate estimates for various blood, resting site, and sugar resource subsets from existing entomological survey data. Reported impacts of insecticidal nets upon human-feeding vectors, and insecticide-treated livestock upon animal-feeding vectors, are approximately consistent with model predictions based on measured utilization rates for those human and animal blood resource subsets. Utilization rates for artificial sugar baits compare well with blood resources, and are consistent with observed impact when insecticide is added. While existing data was used to indirectly measure utilization rates for a variety of resting site subsets, by comparison with measured rates of blood resource utilization in the same settings, current techniques for capturing resting mosquitoes underestimate this quantity, and reliance upon complex models with numerous input parameters may limit the applicability of this approach. CONCLUSIONS: While blood and sugar consumption can be readily quantified using existing methods for detecting natural markers or artificial tracers, improved techniques for labelling mosquitoes, or other arthropod pathogen vectors, will be required to assess vector control measures which target them when they utilize non-nutritional resources such as resting, oviposition, and mating sites.",

        "abstract": "CONTEXT: Forty percent of AIDS cases are reported in the southern United States, the region with the largest proportion of HIV/AIDS cases from rural areas. Data are limited regarding provider perspectives of the accessibility and availability of HIV testing and treatment services in southern rural counties. PURPOSE: We surveyed providers in the rural south to better understand: (1) the accessibility and availability, and (2) the facilitators and barriers of HIV testing and treatment services. METHODS: All county health departments (N = 326) serving populations of <50,000 persons, within 10 southern states, were mailed surveys. Responding health departments identified up to 3 HIV testing sites and up to 3 HIV treatment sites to which they refer clients. FINDINGS: Overall, 243 of 326 (75%) health departments, 133 of 250 (53%) HIV testing sites, and 73 of 152 (48%) HIV treatment sites responded to the surveys. The number of testing sites per county ranged from 0 to 20; the number of treatment sites ranged from 0 to 4. An average distance of 50 miles for clients to travel for HIV treatment was reported by health department respondents as a barrier. Facilitators of HIV testing were (1) integrating HIV testing into other health services; (2) using rapid HIV testing; and (3) establishing easily accessible HIV testing locations and free testing services. CONCLUSION: Providers perceive that distance from local health departments to HIV treatment sites presents a barrier to HIV care for their clients. Future studies should ascertain clients' perspectives to ensure appropriate service provisions.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pregnant and postpartum women may be at increased risk of violent death including homicide and suicide relative to non-pregnant women, but US national data have not been reported since implementation of enhanced mortality surveillance. OBJECTIVE: To estimate homicide and suicide ratios among women who are pregnant or postpartum and to compare their risk of violent death to non-pregnant/non-postpartum women. STUDY DESIGN: Death certificates (n=465,097) from US states with enhanced pregnancy mortality surveillance from 2005-2010 were used to compare mortality among four groups of women age 10-54: pregnant, early postpartum (pregnant within 42 days of death), late postpartum (pregnant within 43 days to 1 year of death) and non-pregnant/non-postpartum. We estimated pregnancy-associated mortality ratios and compared to non-pregnant/non-postpartum mortality ratios in order to identify differences in risk after adjusting for potential levels of pregnancy misclassification as reported in the literature. RESULTS: Pregnancy-associated homicide victims were most frequently young, Black, and undereducated while pregnancy-associated suicide occurred most frequently among older White women. After adjustments, pregnancy-associated homicide risk ranged from 2.2-6.2 per 100,000 live births, depending on the degree of misclassification estimated, compared to 2.5-2.6 per 100,000 non-pregnant/non-postpartum women aged 10-54. Pregnancy-associated suicide risk ranged from 1.6-4.5 per 100,000 live births after adjustments compared to 5.3-5.5 per 100,000 women aged 10-54 among non-pregnant/non-postpartum women. Assuming the most conservative published estimate of misclassification, risk of homicide among pregnant/postpartum women was 1.84 times that of non-pregnant/non-postpartum women (95% confidence interval: 1.71, 1.98) while risk of suicide was decreased (relative risk=0.62, 95% confidence interval: 0.57, 0.68). CONCLUSION: Pregnancy and postpartum appear to be times of increased risk for homicide and decreased risk for suicide among women in the US.",

        "abstract": "Group and serocomplex cross-reactive epitopes have been identified in the envelope (E) protein of several flaviviruses and have proven critical in vaccine and diagnostic antigen development. Here, we performed site-directed mutagenesis across the E gene of a recombinant expression plasmid that encodes the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) premembrane (prM) and E proteins and produces JEV virus-like particles (VLPs). Mutations were introduced at I135 and E138 in domain I; W101, G104, G106 and L107 in domain II; and T305, E306, K312, A315, S329, S331, G332 and D389 in domain III. None of the mutant JEV VLPs demonstrated reduced activity to the five JEV type-specific mAbs tested. Substitutions at W101, especially W101G, reduced reactivity dramatically with all of the flavivirus group cross-reactive mAbs. The group and JEV serocomplex cross-reactive mAbs examined recognized five and six different overlapping epitopes, respectively. Among five group cross-reactive epitopes, amino acids located in domains I, II and III were involved in one, five and three epitopes, respectively. Recognition by six JEV serocomplex cross-reactive mAbs was reduced by amino acid substitutions in domains II and III. These results suggest that amino acid residues located in the fusion loop of E domain II are the most critical for recognition by group cross-reactive mAbs, followed by residues of domains III and I. The amino acid residues of both domains II and III of the E protein were shown to be important in the binding of JEV serocomplex cross-reactive mAbs.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to investigate whether US female adolescents who self-reported having a physical disability or long-term health problem were more likely to report having been physically forced to have sexual intercourse than US female adolescents without a physical disability or long-term health problem. METHODS: Using data from the 2005 U.S. National Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS), we employed logistic regression analyses to estimate the association between physical disability (and other variables) and the risk for sexual violence among US high school girls. RESULTS: Female high school students who reported a physical disability or long-term health problem were more likely to report having been physically forced to have sexual intercourse than those who did not (19.6% vs 9.4%;chi(2) = 14.51, p = .003). Results from our multivariate analysis reveal that this association remained significant (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.57; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10-2.23) after adjusting for certain demographic characteristics, physical health problems, behavioral health risks, and violent conduct. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that adolescent girls in the United States with a physical disability or long-term health problem may be at increased risk for sexual violence. It is important that national efforts to reduce sexual violence consider how to address the unmet needs of children and adolescents with disabilities. As most adolescent girls spend the majority of their time in a school setting, it is of particular importance that school health professionals are aware of the current findings.",

        "abstract": "Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and their alkylated derivatives, such as methylnaphthalenes (MeNs), are harmful pollutants ubiquitously present in the environment. Exposure to PAHs has been linked to a variety of adverse health effects and outcomes, including cancer. Alkyl PAHs have been proposed as petrogenic source indicators because of their relatively high abundance in unburned petroleum products. We report a method to quantify 11 urinary methylnaphthols (Me-OHNs), metabolites of 1- and 2-methylnaphthalenes, and 10 monohydroxy PAH metabolites (OH-PAHs), using automated liquid-liquid extraction and isotope dilution gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS). After spiking urine (1 mL) with 13C-labeled internal standards, the conjugated target analytes were hydrolyzed enzymatically in the presence of ascorbic acid. Then, their free species were preconcentrated into 20 % toluene in pentane, derivatized and quantified by GC-MS/MS. The 11 Me-OHNs eluted as 6 distinct chromatographic peaks, each representing 1 - 3 isomers. Method detection limits were 1.0- 41 pg/mL and the coefficients of variation in quality control materials were 4.7 - 19 %. The method was used to analyze two National Institute of Standards and Technology's Standard Reference Materials(R) and samples from 30 smokers and 30 non-smokers. Geometric mean concentrations were on average 37 (Me-OHNs) and 9.0 (OH-PAHs) fold higher in smokers than in non-smokers. These findings support the usefulness of Me-OHNs as potential biomarkers of non-occupational exposure to MeNs and sources containing MeNs.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Parent-child conversations about human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine may provide parents with the opportunity to talk with their daughters about sexual health. We sought to characterize mothers' communication with their adolescent daughters about HPV vaccine. METHODS: We surveyed 609 mothers of girls aged between 11 and 20 years living in North Carolina in Fall 2008. We used logistic regression to identify the correlates of mother-daughter communication. RESULTS: Most mothers (81%) reported having discussed HPV vaccine with their daughters. For almost half of these families (47%), discussion of HPV vaccine led to a conversation about sex. This was more common among mothers who believed that their daughters may be sexually active (odds ratio [OR]: 1.88; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.25-2.83), had greater knowledge of HPV vaccine (OR: 2.46; 95% CI: 1.07-5.64), lived in urban areas (OR: 1.75; 95% CI: 1.21-2.54), or reported being born-again Christians (OR: 1.74; 95% CI: 1.17-2.58). Most mothers who talked with their daughters about HPV vaccine reported having discussed the reasons for and against getting vaccinated (86%). Mothers most commonly reported having discussed the potential HPV vaccine benefits, usually protection against cervical cancer (56%), and less frequently reported having discussed the perceived disadvantages of HPV vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: HPV vaccine conversations may provide opportunities for sexual health promotion and sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevention.",

        "abstract": "Much of the observed wintertime increase of mortality in temperate regions is attributed to seasonal influenza. A recent reanalysis of laboratory experiments indicates that absolute humidity strongly modulates the airborne survival and transmission of the influenza virus. Here, we extend these findings to the human population level, showing that the onset of increased wintertime influenza-related mortality in the United States is associated with anomalously low absolute humidity levels during the prior weeks. We then use an epidemiological model, in which observed absolute humidity conditions temper influenza transmission rates, to successfully simulate the seasonal cycle of observed influenza-related mortality. The model results indicate that direct modulation of influenza transmissibility by absolute humidity alone is sufficient to produce this observed seasonality. These findings provide epidemiological support for the hypothesis that absolute humidity drives seasonal variations of influenza transmission in temperate regions.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mainland Tanzania scaled up multiple malaria control interventions between 1999 and 2010. We evaluated whether, and to what extent, reductions in all-cause under-five child mortality (U5CM) tracked with malaria control intensification during this period. METHODS: Four nationally representative household surveys permitted trend analysis for malaria intervention coverage, severe anemia (hemoglobin <8 g/dL) prevalence (SAP) among children 6-59 months, and U5CM rates stratified by background characteristics, age, and malaria endemicity. Prevalence of contextual factors (e.g., vaccination, nutrition) likely to influence U5CM were also assessed. Population attributable risk percentage (PAR%) estimates for malaria interventions and contextual factors that changed over time were used to estimate magnitude of impact on U5CM. RESULTS: Household ownership of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) rose from near zero in 1999 to 64% (95% CI, 61.7-65.2) in 2010. Intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy reached 26% (95% CI, 23.6-28.0) by 2010. Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine replaced chloroquine in 2002 and artemisinin-based combination therapy was introduced in 2007. SAP among children 6-59 months declined 50% between 2005 (11.1%; 95% CI, 10.0-12.3%) and 2010 (5.5%; 95% CI, 4.7-6.4%) and U5CM declined by 45% between baseline (1995-9) and endpoint (2005-9), from 148 to 81 deaths/1000 live births, respectively. Mortality declined 55% among children 1-23 months of age in higher malaria endemicity areas. A large reduction in U5CM was attributable to ITNs (PAR% = 11) with other malaria interventions adding further gains. Multiple contextual factors also contributed to survival gains. CONCLUSION: Marked declines in U5CM occurred in Tanzania between 1999 and 2010 with high impact from ITNs and ACTs. High-risk children (1-24 months of age in high malaria endemicity) experienced the greatest declines in mortality and SAP. Malaria control should remain a policy priority to sustain and further accelerate progress in child survival.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In a group of 43 confined space welders dose-effect relationships had been identified for adverse neurological/neuropsychological functional effects in relation to manganese (Mn) in blood or air (cumulative exposure index). The welders' exposure to Mn was unprotected and with poor ventilation, lasting on average 16.5 months. A follow-up examination 3.5 years later, after cessation of confined space welding, was carried out to re-assess the status of mood, movement/neuromotor and cognitive functions, and olfaction. METHODS: In 2008, 26 welders (70% response rate) were retested using a similar methodology as at baseline (Bowler et al., 2007). A general linear model was used to estimate individual-specific endpoint differences over time. Mean age was 47 years, mean years of education 12.4, and mean total years of welding 16.9 years. Thirteen participants no longer welded. RESULTS: At follow-up, mean blood Mn concentration had decreased from 10.0 to 8.4 mcg/L (p=0.002). Those still welding had higher blood Mn than those no longer welding (9.9 mcg/L vs. 6.8 mcg/L, p=0.002). Several domains of cognitive functioning improved substantially as shown by large effect sizes. Emotional disturbance improved only slightly clinically, but complaints of depression and anxiety persisted. Motor dexterity/tactile function and graphomotor tremor improved significantly, while psychomotor speed remained unchanged. The findings of the neurological examination (UPDRS) did not change compared to baseline, whereas rigidity, dominant postural hand tremor and body sway worsened. Olfactory test scores remained depressed. CONCLUSION: After 3.5 years of cessation of confined space welding, only cognitive function improved significantly, while olfactory, extrapyramidal, and mood disturbances remained constant or were exacerbated. This suggests differential intrinsic vulnerabilities of the brain loci involved with Mn exposure. As the Mn exposure of the Bay Bridge welders frequently exceeded the Cal-OSHA TLV of 0.2 mg Mn/m(3) at baseline, a more stringent preventive measure is recommended for confined space welding.",

Studies in agriculture are an exception. We draw upon our experience using this design to study agricultural workers to identify conditions that might foster use of prospective cohorts to study other occupational settings. Prospective cohort studies are perceived by many as the strongest epidemiologic design. It allows updating of information on exposure and other factors, collection of biologic samples before disease diagnosis for biomarker studies, assessment of effect modification by genes, lifestyle, and other occupational exposures, and evaluation of a wide range of health outcomes. Increased use of prospective cohorts would be beneficial in identifying hazardous exposures in the workplace. Occupational epidemiologists should seek opportunities to initiate prospective cohorts to investigate high priority, occupational exposures.",

This study examined various modifications to a commercial nucleic acid extraction procedure in order to enhance PCR detection sensitivity for Cryptosporidium. An alternative DNA extraction buffer allowed for qPCR detection at lower seed levels than a commercial extraction kit buffer. In addition, the use of a second spin column cycle produced significantly better detection (P = 0.031), and the volume of Tris-EDTA buffer significantly affected crossing threshold values (P = 0.001). The improved extraction procedure was evaluated using 10 L of tap water samples processed by ultrafiltration, centrifugation and immunomagnetic separation. Mean recovery for the sample processing method was determined to be 41% using microscopy and 49% by real-time PCR (P = 0.013). The results of this study demonstrate that real-time PCR can be an effective alternative for detecting and quantifying Cryptosporidium parvum in drinking water samples.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Brazil will host the 2014 FIFA World Cup and the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games, events that are expected to attract hundreds of thousands of international travelers. Travelers to Brazil will encounter locally endemic infections as well as mass event-specific risks. METHODS: We describe 1586 ill returned travelers who had visited Brazil and were seen at a GeoSentinel Clinic from July 1997 through May 2013. RESULTS: The most common travel-related illnesses were dermatologic conditions (40%), diarrheal syndromes (25%), and febrile systemic illness (19%). The most common specific dermatologic diagnoses were cutaneous larva migrans, myiasis, and tungiasis. Dengue and malaria, predominantly Plasmodium vivax, were the most frequently identified specific causes of fever and the most common reasons for hospitalization after travel. Dengue fever diagnoses displayed marked seasonality, although cases were seen throughout the year. Among the 28 ill returned travelers with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, 11 had newly diagnosed asymptomatic infection and 9 had acute symptomatic HIV. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis primarily identified infectious diseases among travelers to Brazil. Knowledge of illness in travelers returning from Brazil can assist clinicians to advise prospective travelers and guide pretravel preparation, including itinerary-tailored advice, vaccines, and chemoprophylaxis; it can also help to focus posttravel evaluation of ill returned travelers. Travelers planning to attend mass events will encounter other risks that are not captured in our surveillance network.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV) reduce nasopharyngeal carriage of vaccine type (VT) pneumococci, an important driver of vaccine programs' overall benefits. The dosing schedule that best reduces carriage is unclear. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of English language publications from 1994 to 2010 (supplemented post hoc with studies from 2011) reporting PCV effects on VT carriage to assess variability in effect by dosing schedule. RESULTS: We identified 32 relevant studies (36 citations) from 12,980 citations reviewed. Twenty-one (66%) evaluated PCV7; none used PCV10 or PCV13. Five studies evaluated 2 primary doses and 13 three primary doses. After the first year of life, 14 evaluated 3-dose primary series with PCV booster (3+1), seven 3 doses plus 23-valent polysaccharide booster \"3+1PPV23,\" five \"3+0,\" four \"2+1,\" three \"2+1PPV23\" and two \"2+0.\" Four studies directly compared schedules. From these, 3 primary doses reduced VT carriage more than 2 doses at 1-7 months following the series (1 study significant; 2 borderline). In a study, the 2+1 schedule reduced VT carriage more than 2+0 at 18, but not at 24 months of age. One study of a 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine booster showed no effect. All 16 clinical trials with unvaccinated controls and 11 observational studies with before-after designs showed reduction in VT carriage. CONCLUSIONS: The available literature demonstrates VT-carriage reduction for 2+0, 2+1, 3+0 and 3+1 PCV schedules, but not for 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine booster. Comparisons between schedules show that 3 primary doses and a 2+1 schedule may reduce carriage more than 2 primary doses and a 2+0 schedule, respectively.",

        "abstract": "In March 2013, the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) identified two Doctor's First Reports of Occupational Injury or Illness (DFRs) regarding Los Angeles County residents who had worked at the same jobsite in January 2012 and had been evaluated for possible work-associated coccidioidomycosis (valley fever). Occupational exposure to Coccidioides, the causative fungi, typically is associated with soil-disrupting activities. The physicians noted that both workers were cast or crew members filming a television series episode, and the site of possible exposure was an outdoor set in Ventura County, California. On the basis of their job titles, neither would have been expected to have been engaged in soil-disrupting activities. Los Angeles County Department of Public Health (LACDPH) conducted an outbreak investigation by using CDPH-provided occupational surveillance records, traditional infectious disease surveillance, and social media searches. This report describes the results of that investigation, which identified a total of five laboratory-confirmed and five probable cases linked to this filming event. The employer and site manager were interviewed. The site manager stated that they would no longer allow soil-disruptive work at the site and would incorporate information about the potential risk for Coccidioides exposure onsite into work contracts. Public health professionals, clinicians, and the television and film industry should be aware that employees working outdoors in areas where Coccidioides is endemic (e.g., central and southern California), even those not engaged in soil-disruptive work, might be at risk for coccidioidomycosis.",

        "abstract": "Researchers at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) are conducting mine illumination research with the objective of improving miner safety. Slips, trips, and falls (STFs) are the second leading accident class (18.1%, n=2,374) of nonfatal lost-time injuries at underground mines (MSHA, 2005-2009). Factors contributing to STFs include recognition of hazards as well as postural balance and age. Improved lighting may enable better hazard recognition and reduce the impact of postural balance and age. Previous research has shown that cap lamp technology that used light-emitting diodes (LEDs) has improved hazard detection. This study was an initial investigation to determine if cap lamp lighting significantly influences measures of static postural stability (displacement and velocity of center of pressure). Results of this investigation showed no significant differences in the balance measures of interest between cap lamps tested. However, balance was shown to significantly decline (p<0.05) when tested in an underground coal mine compared to the laboratory testing condition. Relevance to industry Underground coal mine workers wear cap lamps on their hard hats as their primary light source to illuminate nearby areas where their vision is directed. Proper illumination may improve miner safety by improving their STF hazard recognition and balance.",

        "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Although the prevalence and incidence of diabetes have increased in the United States in recent decades, no studies have systematically examined long-term, national trends in the prevalence and incidence of diagnosed diabetes. OBJECTIVE: To examine long-term trends in the prevalence and incidence of diagnosed diabetes to determine whether there have been periods of acceleration or deceleration in rates. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We analyzed 1980-2012 data for 664,969 adults aged 20 to 79 years from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) to estimate incidence and prevalence rates for the overall civilian, noninstitutionalized, US population and by demographic subgroups (age group, sex, race/ethnicity, and educational level). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The annual percentage change (APC) in rates of the prevalence and incidence of diagnosed diabetes (type 1 and type 2 combined). RESULTS: The APC for age-adjusted prevalence and incidence of diagnosed diabetes did not change significantly during the 1980s (for prevalence, 0.2% [95% CI, -0.9% to 1.4%], P = .69; for incidence, -0.1% [95% CI, -2.5% to 2.4%], P = .93), but each increased sharply during 1990-2008 (for prevalence, 4.5% [95% CI, 4.1% to 4.9%], P < .001; for incidence, 4.7% [95% CI, 3.8% to 5.6%], P < .001) before leveling off with no significant change during 2008-2012 (for prevalence, 0.6% [95% CI, -1.9% to 3.0%], P = .64; for incidence, -5.4% [95% CI, -11.3% to 0.9%], P = .09). The prevalence per 100 persons was 3.5 (95% CI, 3.2 to 3.9) in 1990, 7.9 (95% CI, 7.4 to 8.3) in 2008, and 8.3 (95% CI, 7.9 to 8.7) in 2012. The incidence per 1000 persons was 3.2 (95% CI, 2.2 to 4.1) in 1990, 8.8 (95% CI, 7.4 to 10.3) in 2008, and 7.1 (95% CI, 6.1 to 8.2) in 2012. Trends in many demographic subpopulations were similar to these overall trends. However, incidence rates among non-Hispanic black and Hispanic adults continued to increase (for interaction, P = .03 for non-Hispanic black adults and P = .01 for Hispanic adults) at rates significantly greater than for non-Hispanic white adults. In addition, the rate of increase in prevalence was higher for adults who had a high school education or less compared with those who had more than a high school education (for interaction, P = .006 for <high school and P < .001 for high school). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Analyses of nationally representative data from 1980 to 2012 suggest a doubling of the incidence and prevalence of diabetes during 1990-2008, and a plateauing between 2008 and 2012. However, there appear to be continued increases in the prevalence or incidence of diabetes among subgroups, including non-Hispanic black and Hispanic subpopulations and those with a high school education or less.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To examine whether there were long-term (between 1988 and 1994 and 2001 and 2008) and recent (between 2001 and 2004 and 2005 and 2008) changes in blood pressure (BP) levels among U.S. adults with diagnosed diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Using data from National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES), we examined changes in BP distributions, mean BPs, and proportion with BP <140/90 mmHg. RESULTS: Between 1988 and 1994 and 2001 and 2008, for adults with diabetes, mean BPs decreased from 135/72 mmHg to 131/69 mmHg (P < 0.01) and the proportion with BP <140/90 mmHg increased from 64 to 69% (P = 0.01). Although hypertension prevalence increased, hypertension awareness, treatment, and control improved. However, there was no evidence of improvement for adults 20-44 years old. Between 2001 and 2004 and 2005 and 2008, there were no significant changes in BP levels. CONCLUSIONS: BP levels among adults with diabetes improved between 1988 and 1994 and 2001 and 2008, but the progress stalled between 2001 and 2004 and 2005 and 2008. The lack of improvement among young adults is concerning.",

        "abstract": "Nairobi is considered a low-risk area for malaria transmission, but travel can influence transmission of malaria. We investigated the demographic characteristics and travel history of patients with documented fever and malaria in a study clinic in a population-based surveillance system over a 5-year period, January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2011. During the study period, 11,480 (68%) febrile patients had a microscopy test performed for malaria, of which 2,553 (22%) were positive. Malaria was detected year-round with peaks in January, May, and September. Children aged 5-14 years had the highest proportion (28%) of positive results followed by children aged 1-4 years (23%). Almost two-thirds of patients with malaria reported traveling outside Nairobi; 79% of these traveled to three counties in western Kenya. History of recent travel (i.e., in past month) was associated with malaria parasitemia (odds ratio: 10.0, 95% confidence interval: 9.0-11.0). Malaria parasitemia was frequently observed among febrile patients at a health facility in the urban slum of Kibera, Nairobi. The majority of patients had traveled to western Kenya. However, 34% reported no travel history, which raises the possibility of local malaria transmission in this densely populated, urban setting. These findings have important implications for malaria control in large Nairobi settlements.",

        "abstract": "The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has observed that many control rooms and operator compartments in the U.S. mining industry do not have filtration systems capable of maintaining low dust concentrations in these areas. In this study at a mineral processing plant, to reduce respirable dust concentrations in a control room that had no cleaning system for intake air, a filtration and pressurization system originally designed for enclosed cabs was modified and installed. This system was composed of two filtering units: one to filter outside air and one to filter and recirculate the air inside the control room. Eighty-seven percent of submicrometer particles were reduced by the system under static conditions. This means that greater than 87 percent of respirable dust particles should be reduced as the particle-size distribution of respirable dust particles is greater than that of submicrometer particles, and filtration systems usually are more efficient in capturing the larger particles. A positive pressure near 0.02 inches of water gauge was produced, which is an important component of an effective system and minimizes the entry of particles, such as dust, into the room. The intake airflow was around 118 cfm, greater than the airflow suggested by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) for acceptable indoor air quality. After one year, the loading of the filter caused the airflow to decrease to 80 cfm, which still produces acceptable indoor air quality. Due to the loading of the filters, the reduction efficiency for submicrometer particles under static conditions increased to 94 percent from 87 percent.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Respiratory therapists (RTs) and other health-care workers are potentially exposed to a variety of aerosolized medications. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Health and Safety Practices Survey of Healthcare Workers describes current exposure control practices and barriers to using personal protective equipment during administration of selected aerosolized medications. METHODS: An anonymous, multi-module, web-based survey was conducted among members of health-care professional practice organizations representing RTs, nurses, and other health-care practitioners. A module on aerosolized medications included submodules for antibiotics (amikacin, colistin, and tobramycin), pentamidine, and ribavirin. RESULTS: The submodules on antibiotics, pentamidine, and ribavirin were completed by 321, 227, and 50 respondents, respectively, most of whom were RTs. The relatively low number of ribavirin respondents precluded meaningful interpretation of these data and may reflect the rare use of this drug. Consequently, analysis focused on pentamidine, classified by NIOSH as a hazardous drug, and the antibiotics amikacin, colistin, and tobramycin, which currently lack authoritative safe handling guidelines. Respondents who administered pentamidine were more likely to adhere to good work practices compared with those who administered the antibiotics. Examples included training received on safe handling procedures (75% vs 52%), availability of employer standard procedures (82% vs 55%), use of aerosol delivery devices equipped with an expiratory filter (96% vs 53%) or negative-pressure rooms (61% vs 20%), and always using respiratory protection (51% vs 13%). CONCLUSIONS: Despite the availability of safe handling guidelines for pentamidine, implementation was not universal, placing workers, co-workers, and even family members at risk of exposure. Although the antibiotics included in this study lack authoritative safe handling guidelines, prudence dictates that appropriate exposure controls be used to minimize exposure to the antibiotics and other aerosolized medications. Employers and employees share responsibility for ensuring that precautionary measures are taken to keep exposures to all aerosolized medications as low as practicable.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Current U.S. guidelines recommend consideration of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) for pregnant smokers if behavioral therapies fail, only under close supervision of a provider, and after discussion of known risks of continued smoking and possible risks of NRT. The percentage of pregnant smokers offered NRT by their prenatal care providers is unknown. PURPOSE: The study aims to calculate the percentage of pregnant smokers offered cessation intervention and NRT and assess independent associations between selected maternal characteristics and being offered NRT. METHODS: Data were analyzed from the 2009-2010 Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System from four states that asked about provider practices for prenatal smoking cessation. Adjusted prevalence ratios were calculated to examine associations between being offered NRT, selected maternal characteristics, and smoking level. Variables used in adjusted models were based on factors associated with smoking cessation during pregnancy from prior literature and included race, age, education, insurance type, and stress. RESULTS: Of 3559 women who smoked 3 months before pregnancy, 77.4% (95% CI: 74.2, 80.3) of 3rd trimester smokers and 42% (95% CI: 38.5, 46.4) of women who quit smoking during pregnancy were offered at least one cessation method. Among smokers, 19.1% (95% CI: 16.5, 22.1) were offered NRT and of these, almost all (94%) were offered another cessation method. CONCLUSIONS: One in five pregnant smokers was offered NRT. About a quarter of pregnant smokers did not receive any interventions to stop smoking. There may still be reluctance to provide NRT to pregnant women, despite known harms of continued smoking during pregnancy.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to develop alternative Strain Index risk classification categories. BACKGROUND: Strain Index scores are usually categorized into four Strain Index risk categories. The original risk categories were developed in the meat-packing industry and may not be fully applicable to other industries. METHOD: Daily Strain Index scores were estimated among 276 manufacturing workers participating in a cohort study of occupational risk factors for hand arm musculoskeletal symptoms. Each score was categorized using the original method and a new method based on quartiles of Strain Index score values among symptomatic participants. Models examining associations between original Strain Index risk categories and incident hand arm symptoms were compared to models examining associations between the alternative Strain Index risk categories and incident hand arm symptoms. RESULTS: Compared to the respective referent categories, a twofold or greater increase in the risk of incident hand arm symptoms was observed for the highest original Strain Index risk category (HR = 2.06, 95% CI = [1.08-3.92]) and for the second highest alternate Strain Index risk exposure category (HR = 2.21, 95% CI = [1.26-3.85]). Although significant associations between Strain Index risk category and incident hand arm symptoms were observed for both Strain Index categorization methods, model fit statistics favored the alternate approach. CONCLUSION: Results from this study suggests that the Strain Index risk category structure may need to be tailored to specific populations. APPLICATION: If verified, results from this study provide a better way to identify hazardous manufacturing jobs and target them for exposure reduction.",

        "abstract": "A simple serodiagnostic test based on the Mycobacterium leprae-specific phenolic glycolipid, PGL-I, for individuals with leprosy is nearly universally positive in leprosy patients with high bacillary loads, but cannot be used as a stand-alone diagnostic test for the entire spectrum of the disease process. For patients with early infection with no detectable acid fast bacilli in lesions or with low or no antibody titer to PGL-I as in those at the tuberculoid end of the disease spectrum, this diagnostic approach has limited usefulness. To identify additional M. leprae antigens that might enhance the serological detection of these individuals, we have examined the reactivity patterns of patient sera to PGL-I, lipoarabinomannan (LAM) and six recombinant M. leprae proteins (ML1877, ML0841, ML2028, ML2038, ML0380 and ML0050) by Western blot and ELISA. Overall, the responses to ML2028 (Ag85B) and ML2038 (bacterioferritin) were consistently high in both multibacillary and paucibacillary groups and weak or absent in endemic controls, while responses to other antigens showed considerable variability, from strongly positive to completely negative. This analysis has given a clearer understanding of some of the differences in the antibody responses, between individuals at opposite ends of the disease spectrum, as well as illustrating the heterogeneity of antibody responses towards protein, carbohydrate, and glycolipid antigens within a clinical group. Correlating these response patterns with a particular disease state would allow for a more critical assessment of the form of disease within the leprosy spectrum and could lead to better patient management.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Antibiotic use predisposes patients to Clostridium difficile infections (CDI), and approximately 32% of these infections are community-associated (CA) CDI. The population-level impact of antibiotic use on adult CA-CDI rates is not well described. METHODS: We used 2011 active population- and laboratory-based surveillance data from 9 US geographic locations to identify adult CA-CDI cases, defined as C difficile-positive stool specimens (by toxin or molecular assay) collected from outpatients or from patients </=3 days after hospital admission. All patients were surveillance area residents and aged >/=20 years with no positive test </=8 weeks prior and no overnight stay in a healthcare facility </=12 weeks prior. Outpatient oral antibiotic prescriptions dispensed in 2010 were obtained from the IMS Health Xponent database. Regression models examined the association between outpatient antibiotic prescribing and adult CA-CDI rates. RESULTS: Healthcare providers prescribed 5.2 million courses of antibiotics among adults in the surveillance population in 2010, for an average of 0.73 per person. Across surveillance sites, antibiotic prescription rates (0.50-0.88 prescriptions per capita) and unadjusted CA-CDI rates (40.7-139.3 cases per 100 000 persons) varied. In regression modeling, reducing antibiotic prescribing rates by 10% among persons >/=20 years old was associated with a 17% (95% confidence interval, 6.0%-26.3%; P = .032) decrease in CA-CDI rates after adjusting for age, gender, race, and type of diagnostic assay. Reductions in prescribing penicillins and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid were associated with the greatest decreases in CA-CDI rates. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Community-associated CDI prevention should include reducing unnecessary outpatient antibiotic use. A modest reduction of 10% in outpatient antibiotic prescribing can have a disproportionate impact on reducing CA-CDI rates.",

        "abstract": "We examined the influence of duration of exclusive breastfeeding (DEBF) for a mother's earlier children on the DEBF for her later children among multiparous women from the 2002 National Survey of Family Growth. DEBF was categorized as: never breastfed (NBF) (referent); not exclusively breastfed or exclusively breastfed for <4 months (EBF < 4); and exclusively breastfed for >/=4 months (EBF >/= 4). We examined DEBF using weighted percentages and odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) from multinomial logistic regression models, adjusting for maternal factors. About 70% of multiparous women (n = 2,149) repeated the duration of exclusive breastfeeding of their first child for their second child; 14% of women repeated EBF >/= 4. Among multiparous women, the adjusted odds ratio for EBF >/= 4 for second children was 7.2 (95% CI = 4.0-12.9) when first children were EBF < 4 and 90.7 (95% CI = 45.4-181.4) when first children were EBF >/= 4, relative to NBF first children. In analyses where DEBF of third children was the outcome, odds of EBF >/= 4 were more strongly influenced by DEBF of second children while the impact of DEBF of first children was not as strong. Older maternal age and being married were related to an increased DEBF. Being married at second birth predicted a change from NBF for first children to EBF >/= 4 for second children (OR = 6.2, 95% CI = 2.7-14.2). In conclusion, mothers generally repeated the DEBF of their previous child. For third children, DEBF of the second child was more likely to be repeated than that of the first child.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Evidence linking violence against women and HIV has grown, including on the cycle of violence and the links between violence against children and women. To create an effective response to the HIV epidemic, it is key to prevent sexual violence against children and intimate partner violence (IPV) against adolescent girls. METHODS: Authors analyzed data from national household surveys on violence against children undertaken by governments in Swaziland, Tanzania, Kenya, and Zimbabwe, with support of the Together for Girls initiative, as well as an analysis of evidence on effective programmes. RESULTS: Data show that sexual and physical violence in childhood are linked to negative health outcomes, including increased sexual risk taking (eg, inconsistent condom use and increased number of sexual partners), and that girls begin experiencing IPV (emotional, physical, and sexual) during adolescence. Evidence on effective programmes addressing childhood sexual violence is growing. Key interventions focus on increasing knowledge among children and caregivers by addressing attitudes and practices around violence, including dating relationships. Programmes also seek to build awareness of services available for children who experience violence. DISCUSSION: Findings include incorporating attention to children into HIV and violence programmes directed to adults; increased coordination and leveraging of resources between these programmes; test transferability of programmes in low- and middle-income countries; and invest in data collection and robust evaluations of interventions to prevent sexual violence and IPV among children. CONCLUSIONS: This article contributes to a growing body of evidence on the prevention of sexual violence and HIV in children.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) conjugate vaccine has dramatically reduced invasive Hib disease worldwide. Yet, data on protection against pneumonia and among children with HIV are limited. We evaluated the impact of Hib conjugate vaccine introduction in 2009 in a rural, high-HIV prevalence area in Mozambique. STUDY DESIGN: From 2006-2011, we conducted hospital-based surveillance for invasive Hib disease and clinical pneumonia (classified as severe and very severe) among children <5 years of age. Incidences calculated using population denominators were compared between baseline (2006-2008) and post-Hib conjugate vaccine (2010-2011) periods. Surveillance data for radiologically-confirmed pneumonia among children <2 years of age in 2011 were compared with baseline data from 2004-2006. RESULTS: Among 50 cases of invasive Hib disease, 5 occurred after Hib conjugate vaccine introduction; 1 case-patient was age-eligible for Hib conjugate vaccine (and had received 3 doses). Four post-Hib conjugate vaccine case-patients (including Hib conjugate vaccine failure) had HIV. Among children <1 and <5 years of age, significant reductions occurred in rates of invasive Hib disease (91% and 85%, respectively) and very severe pneumonia (29% and 34%, respectively). Radiologically-confirmed pneumonia incidence fell significantly (33%) in children <2 years of age. Severe pneumonia incidence did not decline. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate important reductions in invasive disease and pneumonia following Hib conjugate vaccine introduction in a high-HIV area. Continued surveillance is needed to monitor long-term Hib conjugate vaccine effects, particularly among children with HIV.",

During 1960-2010, a total of 22 countries in Africa reported sporadic cases or outbreaks of dengue; 12 other countries in Africa reported dengue only in travelers. The presence of disease and high prevalence of antibody to dengue virus in limited serologic surveys suggest endemic dengue virus infection in all or many parts of Africa. Dengue is likely underrecognized and underreported in Africa because of low awareness by health care providers, other prevalent febrile illnesses, and lack of diagnostic testing and systematic surveillance. Other hypotheses to explain low reported numbers of cases include cross-protection from other endemic flavivirus infections, genetic host factors protecting against infection or disease, and low vector competence and transmission efficiency. Population-based studies of febrile illness are needed to determine the epidemiology and true incidence of dengue in Africa.",

METHODS: Data come from the Second Injury Control and Risk Survey, Phase 2 (ICARIS2-P2), conducted from March 2007 to May 2008. Prevalence estimates were calculated for older adults (aged >/=65) and multivariable logistic regression was used to explore associations between assistive device use and mobility-related characteristics. RESULT: Compared with non-users, assistive device users were more likely to report a recent fall (AOR 12.0; 95% CI 4.9-29.3), limit walking outside due to concerns about falling (AOR 7.1; 95% CI 2.6-19.1), be unable to walk outside for 10min without resting (AOR 3.3; 95% CI 1.1-9.3), and be no longer driving (AOR 6.7; 95% CI 2.0-22.3). CONCLUSION: Assistive device users have limited mobility and an increased risk for fall injury compared with non-users. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Effective fall prevention interventions, and innovative transportation options, are needed to protect the mobility of this high-risk group.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: High rates of typhoid fever in children in urban settings in Asia have led to focus on childhood immunization in Asian cities, but not in Africa, where data, mostly from rural areas, have shown low disease incidence. We set out to compare incidence of typhoid fever in a densely populated urban slum and a rural community in Kenya, hypothesizing higher rates in the urban area, given crowding and suboptimal access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene. METHODS: During 2007-9, we conducted population-based surveillance in Kibera, an urban informal settlement in Nairobi, and in Lwak, a rural area in western Kenya. Participants had free access to study clinics; field workers visited their homes biweekly to collect information about acute illnesses. In clinic, blood cultures were processed from patients with fever or pneumonia. Crude and adjusted incidence rates were calculated. RESULTS: In the urban site, the overall crude incidence of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) bacteremia was 247 cases per 100,000 person-years of observation (pyo) with highest rates in children 5-9 years old (596 per 100,000 pyo) and 2-4 years old (521 per 100,000 pyo). Crude overall incidence in Lwak was 29 cases per 100,000 pyo with low rates in children 2-4 and 5-9 years old (28 and 18 cases per 100,000 pyo, respectively). Adjusted incidence rates were highest in 2-4 year old urban children (2,243 per 100,000 pyo) which were >15-fold higher than rates in the rural site for the same age group. Nearly 75% of S. Typhi isolates were multi-drug resistant. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic urban slum and rural comparison showed dramatically higher typhoid incidence among urban children <10 years old with rates similar to those from Asian urban slums. The findings have potential policy implications for use of typhoid vaccines in increasingly urban Africa.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE:  In March of 2008, an expert panel was convened at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to develop code-based case definitions for abusive head trauma (AHT) in children under 5 years of age based on the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) nature and cause of injury codes. This study presents the operational case definition and applies it to US death data. METHODS: National Center for Health Statistics National Vital Statistics System data on multiple cause-of-death from 2003 to 2007 were examined. RESULTS: Inspection of records with at least one ICD-10 injury/disease code and at least one ICD-10 cause code from the AHT case definition resulted in the identification of 780 fatal AHT cases, with 699 classified as definite/presumptive AHT and 81 classified as probable AHT. The fatal AHT rate was highest among children age <1 year with a peak in incidence that occurred at 1-2 months of age. Fatal AHT incidence rates were higher for men than women and were higher for non-Hispanic African-Americans compared to other racial/ethnic groups. Fatal AHT incidence was relatively constant across seasons. CONCLUSIONS: This report demonstrates that the definition can help to identify population subgroups at higher risk for AHT defined by year and month of death, age, sex and race/ethnicity. This type of definition may be useful for various epidemiological applications including research and surveillance. These activities can in turn inform further development of prevention activities, including educating parents about the dangers of shaking and strategies for managing infant crying.",

        "abstract": "Leishmania parasites are the etiological agents of leishmaniosis, with severe course and often fatal prognosis, and the global number of cases has increased in recent decades. The gold standards for the diagnosis of leishmaniosis are microscopic examinations and culture in vitro of the different clinical specimens. The sensitivity of these methods is insufficient. Recent development in specific and sensitive molecular methods (PCR) allows for detection as well as identification of the parasite species (subspecies). The aim of the study was to estimate the usefulness of molecular methods (PCR) for detection of Leishmania species and consequently for the implementation of such methods in routine diagnostics of leishmaniosis in Polish patients returning from endemic areas of the disease. In our investigations we used 54 known Leishmania positive DNA templates (from culture and clinical specimens) received from the CDC (Atlanta, GA, USA). Moreover, 25 samples of bone marrow, blood or other tissues obtained from 18 Polish individuals suspected of leishmaniosis were also examined. In PCR we used two pairs of primers specific to the conserved region of Leishmania kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) minicircle (13A/13B and F/R). Using these primers we obtained amplicons in all DNA templates from the CDC and in three Polish patients suspected for Leishmania infection. In one sample from among these cases we also obtained positive results with DNA isolated from a blood specimen which was previously negative in microscopic examinations.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Congenital syphilis (CS) results when an infected pregnant mother transmits syphilis to her unborn child prior to or at delivery. The severity of infection can range from a delivery at term without signs of infection to stillbirth or death after delivery. OBJECTIVES: To describe congenital syphilis (CS) morbidity and mortality during 1999-2013. STUDY DESIGN: National CS case data reported to CDC during 1999-2013 were analyzed. Cases were classified as \"dead cases\" (stillbirths and deaths up to twelve months after delivery), \"morbid cases\" (cases with \"strong\" (physical, radiographic, and/or non-serologic laboratory) evidence of CS), and \"non-morbid\" cases (cases with a normal physical examination reported, but without strong evidence of infection). Annual rates of these cases were calculated. Cases were compared using selected maternal and infant criteria. RESULTS: During 1999-2013, 6,383 cases of CS were reported: 6.5% (dead), 33.6% (morbid), 53.9% (non-morbid), and 5.9% (unknown morbidity); 81.8% of dead cases were stillbirths. Rates of dead, morbid, and non-morbid cases all decreased over this time period, but the overall proportions that were dead or morbid cases did not significantly change. The overall case fatality ratio during 1999-2013 was 6.5%. Among cases of CS, maternal race/ethnicity was not associated with increased morbidity or death, although most cases (83%) occurred among black or Hispanic mothers. No or inadequate treatment for maternal syphilis, less than ten prenatal visits, and maternal non-treponemal titer >/= 1:8 increased the likelihood of a dead case; risk of being a dead case increased with maternal non-treponemal titer (chi2 for trend p<0.001). Infants with CS born alive at <28 weeks gestation (RR=107.4, p<0.001) or born weighing <1,500 grams (RR=43.9, p<0.001) were at greatly increased risk of death. CONCLUSIONS: CS remains an important preventable cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality, with comparable case fatality ratios during 1999-2013 (6.5%) and 1992-1998 (6.4%). Detection and treatment of syphilis early during pregnancy remain crucial to reducing CS morbidity and mortality.",

METHODS: The intervention included consultation for nurse managers to implement changes on patient-care units and educational programming for patient-care staff to facilitate improvements in safety and health behaviors. We used a mixed-methods approach to evaluate feasibility and efficacy. RESULTS: Using findings from process tracking and qualitative research, we observed challenges to implementing the intervention due to the physical demands, time constraints, and psychological strains of patient care. Using survey data, we found no significant intervention effects. CONCLUSIONS: Beyond educating individual workers, systemwide initiatives that respond to conditions of work might be needed to transform the workplace culture and broader milieu in support of worker health and safety.",

However, the development of effective and long-lasting HuNoV vaccines and therapeutics has been greatly hindered by their uncultivability. We recently demonstrated that a HuNoV replicates in human B cells, and that commensal bacteria serve as a cofactor for this infection. In this protocol, we provide detailed methods for culturing the GII.4-Sydney HuNoV strain directly in human B cells, and in a coculture system in which the virus must cross a confluent epithelial barrier to access underlying B cells. We also describe methods for bacterial stimulation of HuNoV B cell infection and for measuring viral attachment to the surface of B cells. Finally, we highlight variables that contribute to the efficiency of viral replication in this system. Infection assays require 3 d and attachment assays require 3 h. Analysis of infection or attachment samples, including RNA extraction and RT-qPCR, requires approximately 6 h.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The prevalence of childhood asthma in the United States increased from 8.7% in 2001 to 9.5% in 2011. This increased prevalence adds to the costs incurred by state Medicaid programs. We provide state-based cost estimates of pediatric asthma emergency department (ED) visits and highlight an opportunity for states to reduce these costs through a recently changed Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) regulation. METHODS: We used a cross-sectional design across multiple data sets to produce state-based cost estimates for asthma-related ED visits among children younger than 18, where Medicaid/CHIP (Children's Health Insurance Program) was the primary payer. RESULTS: There were approximately 629,000 ED visits for pediatric asthma for Medicaid/CHIP enrollees, which cost $272 million in 2010. The average cost per visit was $433. Costs ranged from $282,000 in Alaska to more than $25 million in California. CONCLUSIONS: Costs to states for pediatric asthma ED visits vary widely. Effective January 1, 2014, the CMS rule expanded which type of providers can be reimbursed for providing preventive services to Medicaid/CHIP beneficiaries. This rule change, in combination with existing flexibility for states to define practice setting, allows state Medicaid programs to reimburse for asthma interventions that use nontraditional providers (such as community health workers or certified asthma educators) in a nonclinical setting, as long as the service was initially recommended by a physician or other licensed practitioner. The rule change may help states reduce Medicaid costs of asthma treatment and the severity of pediatric asthma.",

        "abstract": "In the last decade since the rise in occupational safety and health (OSH) research focusing on nanomaterials, some progress has been made in generating the health effects and exposure data needed to perform risk assessment and develop risk management guidance. Yet, substantial research gaps remain, as do challenges in the translation of these research findings to OSH guidance and workplace practice. Risk assessment is a process that integrates the hazard, exposure, and dose-response data to characterize risk in a population (e.g. workers), in order to provide health information needed for risk management decision-making. Thus, the research priorities for risk assessment are those studies that will reduce the uncertainty in the key factors that influence the estimates. Current knowledge of OSH in nanotechnology includes the following: (i) nanomaterials can be measured using standard measurement methods (respirable mass or number concentration), (ii) workplace exposures to nanomaterials can be reduced using engineering controls and personal protective equipment, and (iii) current toxicity testing and risk assessment methods are applicable to nanomaterials. Yet, to ensure protection of workers' health, research is still needed to develop (i) sensitive and quantitative measures of workers' exposure to nanomaterials, (ii) validation methods for exposure controls, and (iii) standardized criteria to categorize hazard data, including better prediction of chronic effects. This article provides a state-of-the-art overview on translating current hazard research data and risk assessment methods for nanomaterials to the development and implementation of effective risk management guidance.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: To the authors's knowledge, there are few published prospective cohort studies of colonoscopy complications in patients at average risk for colorectal cancer who received colorectal cancer screening from a community-based program. In this article, the authors report the rate of colonoscopy complications in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)'s Colorectal Cancer Screening Demonstration Program (CRCSDP), which provided colorectal cancer screening to a medically underserved population aged 50 years to 64 years for screening, diagnostic follow-up after positive stool blood tests, and surveillance purposes. METHODS: Clinical data were collected prospectively from 5 community-based colorectal cancer screening programs. Complications were identified by reviewing the standardized clinical data and medical complication reporting forms submitted by the programs to the CDC. Serious complications were defined as conditions or symptoms that resulted in hospital admission within 30 days after the procedure, including perforation, gastrointestinal bleeding requiring or not requiring blood transfusion, cardiopulmonary events, postpolypectomy syndrome, excessive abdominal pain, or death. RESULTS: A total of 3215 individuals underwent 3355 colonoscopies. Of these, 89% of the colonoscopies were conducted for screening, 9% were conducted for diagnostic follow-up, and 2% were conducted for surveillance purposes. The mean age of the individuals was 55.9 years. Eight individuals experienced serious complications, for an incidence of 2.38 per 1000 colonoscopies. Three patients experienced bowel perforations that required surgery, 1 patient was hospitalized for postpolypectomy bleeding, 3 patients experienced cardiopulmonary events, and 1 patient visited the emergency room for excessive abdominal pain and underwent surgery for an identified colorectal mass. No deaths were reported. CONCLUSIONS: In the CDC's CRCSDP, in which a total of 3215 individuals underwent 3355 colonoscopies, the overall incidence of serious complications from colonoscopy was found to be low.",

        "abstract": "SETTING: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Environmental Public Health Tracking Program is leading an initiative to build a National Environmental Public Health Tracking Network (Tracking Network) that integrates data into a network of standardized electronic data to provide valid scientific information on environmental exposures and adverse health conditions, as well as spatial and temporal relations between them. The Web-based Tracking Network is designed for different audiences including government, the academic community, and the public. A primary goal of the Tracking Network is to allow the exploration of data on health effects, environments, and demographics. The wide variety of data types along with stratifications present a complex problem when developing system functionality to query and display disparate data simultaneously in a comparable way using charts, tables, and maps. OBJECTIVE: While the ability to query and display data that span across geographies and multiple time periods for a single type of data has been the main feature set of the Tracking Network, allowing the same for multiple data types is needed to enable users to explore trends and possible associations among health and environmental data. METHODS: As a first step, a multidisciplinary team was formed to address complex issues related to developing the ability to view multiple measures on the Tracking Network. The team then iterated through steps involving requirements gathering, the segmentation of the requirements into functional areas, submission of proposals to address those functional areas, and finally evaluation of the proposals to address functional areas. CONCLUSIONS: Adding the ability to view multiple measures is an important step to improve Tracking Network users' exploration of the environmental health status of their communities. With this capability, public health practitioners and other users can formulate hypotheses, analyze trends, and explore possible relationships across a wide variety of environmental and health information.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this study was to determine low-seam mine worker exposure to various postures as they pertain to job classifications and job tasks. Sixty-four mine workers from four low-seam coal mines participated. The mine workers reported the tasks they were required to complete and the two postures they used most frequently to perform them. They were provided with a schematic of postures from which to select. The two postures reported most frequently were identified for each task along with the job classification of the workers performing the tasks. Of the 18 tasks reported, over two thirds were performed by at least two different job classifications and over one third were performed by four or more job classifications. Across tasks, the postures used appeared to vary greatly. However, when grouped by job classification, the most frequently reported posture across all job classifications was kneeling near full flexion. Operating the continuous miner was associated with frequent squatting and was likely used because it affords great mobility, allowing operators to move quickly to avoid hazards. However, for environments with a restricted vertical height such as low-seam mining, the authors recommend squatting be avoided as data demonstrates that large amounts of femoral rollback and high muscle activity for the extensors when performing lateral lifts in this posture. Kneeling near full flexion was reported as the most frequently used posture by all job classifications and was likely due to the fact that it requires the least amount of muscle activity to maintain and has reduced pressures at the knee. However, the authors recommend this posture be avoided when performing lateral lifting tasks. Like squatting, kneeling near full flexion results in increased femoral rollback and may increase the stresses applied to the meniscus. Unlike lateral lifting, maintaining a static posture results in knee loading and muscle activity such that the mine worker should consider kneeling near full flexion and sitting on their heels. Although kneeling near full flexion is associated with injuries, there are benefits to this posture that are realized when statically kneeling (minimal muscle activity, allows worker to maintain an upright torso in low heights, and decreased loading at the knee). However, cartilage is avascular and nourished by synovial fluid. Therefore, one should frequently rotate between postures, assuming a more upright kneeling posture when possible and frequently fully flexing and extending the knee allowing nutrients to the cartilage. Relevance to industry: In 2009, over one fourth of underground coal mines that produced coal in the United States were considered low seam with an average working height of <109.2 cm (MSHA, 2009) restricting workers to their knees. Data exists regarding the biomechanical implications of kneeling postures and demonstrates the possibility of detrimental consequences to varying degrees for each posture. With each posture posing a different level of exposure to musculoskeletal disorder risk factors, it is essential to determine the postures mine workers use to perform their job tasks and how their postural options are restricted by the low-seam underground mining environment.",

OBJECTIVE: The objective was to describe seafood consumption in US adults and to explore the relation between seafood consumption and blood mercury. DESIGN: Seafood consumption, obtained from a food-frequency questionnaire, and blood mercury data were available for 10,673 adults who participated in the 2007-2010 NHANES-a cross-sectional nationally representative sample of the US population. Seafood consumption was categorized by type (fish or shellfish) and by frequency of consumption (0, 1-2, 3-4, or >/=5 times/mo). Linear trends in geometric mean blood mercury concentrations by frequency of seafood consumption were tested. Logistic regression analyses examined the odds of blood mercury concentrations >/=5.8 mug/L (as identified by the National Research Council) based on frequency of the specific type of seafood consumed (included in the model as a continuous variables) adjusted for sex, age, and race/Hispanic origin. RESULTS: In 2007-2010, 83.0% +/- 0.7% (+/-SE) of adults consumed seafood in the preceding month. In adults consuming seafood, the blood mercury concentration increased as the frequency of seafood consumption increased (P < 0.001). In 2007-2010, 4.6% +/- 0.39% of adults had blood mercury concentrations >/=5.8 mug/L. Results of the logistic regression on blood mercury concentrations >/=5.8 mug/L showed no association with shrimp (P = 0.21) or crab (P = 0.48) consumption and a highly significant positive association with consumption of high-mercury fish (adjusted OR per unit monthly consumption: 4.58; 95% CI: 2.44, 8.62; P < 0.001), tuna (adjusted OR: 1.14; 95% CI: 1.10, 1.17; P < 0.001), salmon (adjusted OR: 1.14; 95% CI: 1.09, 1.20; P < 0.001), and other seafood (adjusted OR: 1.12; 95% CI: 1.08, 1.15; P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Most US adults consume seafood, and the blood mercury concentration is associated with the consumption of tuna, salmon, high-mercury fish, and other seafood.",

Primers were designed to analyze the sequences at eight amino acid positions E119, R152, D198, I222, S250, H274, R371, and G402 (universal A/N2 numbering) in the neuraminidase (NA) which have been previously found to be associated with resistance or reduced susceptibility to oseltamivir and/or zanamivir in the NA inhibition assay. In addition, the designed primers could be utilized to the distinguish between the NAs of influenza B viruses from the two major lineages (Victoria and Yamagata) that have co-circulated globally in recent years, thus providing a valuable tool for virus strain surveillance.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Nodding Syndrome (NS), an unexplained illness characterized by spells of head bobbing, has been reported in Sudan and Tanzania, perhaps as early as 1962. Hypothesized causes include sorghum consumption, measles, and onchocerciasis infection. In 2009, a couple thousand cases were reportedly in Northern Uganda. METHODS: In December 2009, we identified cases in Kitgum District. The case definition included persons who were previously developmentally normal who had nodding. Cases, further defined as 5- to 15-years-old with an additional neurological deficit, were matched to village controls to assess risk factors and test biological specimens. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate associations. RESULTS: Surveillance identified 224 cases; most (95%) were 5-15-years-old (range = 2-27). Cases were reported in Uganda since 1997. The overall prevalence was 12 cases per 1,000 (range by parish = 0.6-46). The case-control investigation (n = 49 case/village control pairs) showed no association between NS and previously reported measles; sorghum was consumed by most subjects. Positive onchocerciasis serology [age-adjusted odds ratio (AOR1) = 14.4 (2.7, 78.3)], exposure to munitions [AOR1 = 13.9 (1.4, 135.3)], and consumption of crushed roots [AOR1 = 5.4 (1.3, 22.1)] were more likely in cases. Vitamin B6 deficiency was present in the majority of cases (84%) and controls (75%). CONCLUSION: NS appears to be increasing in Uganda since 2000 with 2009 parish prevalence as high as 46 cases per 1,000 5- to 15-year old children. Our results found no supporting evidence for many proposed NS risk factors, revealed association with onchocerciasis, which for the first time was examined with serologic testing, and raised nutritional deficiencies and toxic exposures as possible etiologies.",

        "abstract": "Researchers at NIOSH are developing methods for characterizing ultrafine aerosols in workplaces. One method includes the detailed analysis of collected particles using electron microscopy (EM). In order to collect samples for EM at remote workplaces including mining and manufacturing facilities, researchers have developed a handheld electrostatic precipitator (ESP) particle sampler capable of collecting airborne particles including nanoscale materials, for subsequent EM analysis. The handheld ESP has been tested in the laboratory and is currently undergoing beta testing in the field. Gross collection efficiencies were measured with a CPC and net efficiencies by EM analysis of collected samples. Using laboratory-generated NaCl aerosols in the 30-400 nm size range at a flow rate of 55 cc/min and ESP operating voltages between 5.6- 6.8 kV, both gross and net efficiencies were measured and showed a similar correlation with voltage, with maximum efficiency of approximately 86% at 6.4 kV. EM images from samples were also used to estimate particle size distributions of the original aerosols and the size-dependent deposition was evaluated for upstream versus downstream locations on the sample media. Results suggest that the number concentration and particle size distribution of sampled aerosols may potentially be estimated from a single ESP sample, but that the accuracy and repeatability of such quantification need to be investigated and refined. NIOSH is planning to license the ESP sampler for commercial manufacturing.",

The MNV in animal manures had similar behavior as pure MNV, however, MNV in biosolids had significantly higher attachment as well as internalization than pure MNV or MNV in manures. The incubation time of MNV in biosolids or manure did not affect the attachment. Confocal microscopy was used to observe MNV on lettuce after directly adding SYBR-gold labeled MNV on to lettuce or after the lettuce was submersed in labeled virus. MNV was observed on the lettuce surface, inside the open cut and occasionally within the stomata. In general, the lettuce with a long cut on the edge and short cuts on the stems was more likely to contain internalized MNV than intact lettuce pieces as observed by confocal microscopy; however, while the difference was visible it was not statistically significant. The study showed that MNV in biosolids may increase the risk of fresh produce contamination, and the MNV in open cuts and stomata is likely to be protected from sanitization.",

        "abstract": "Plasmodium vivax has unique attributes to support its survival in varying ecologies and climates. These include hypnozoite forms in the liver, an invasion preference for reticulocytes, caveola-vesicle complex structures in the infected erythrocyte membrane and rapidly forming and circulating gametocytes. These characteristics make this species very different from P. falciparum. Plasmodium cynomolgi and other related simian species have identical biology and can serve as informative models of P. vivax infections. Plasmodium vivax and its model parasites can be grown in non-human primates (NHP), and in short-term ex vivo cultures. For P. vivax, in the absence of in vitro culture systems, these models remain highly relevant side by side with human clinical studies. While post-genomic technologies allow for greater exploration of P. vivax-infected blood samples from humans, these come with restrictions. Two advantages of NHP models are that infections can be experimentally tailored to address hypotheses, including genetic manipulation. Also, systems biology approaches can capitalise on computational biology combined with set experimental infection periods and protocols, which may include multiple sampling times, different types of samples, and the broad use of \"omics\" technologies. Opportunities for research on vivax malaria are increasing with the use of existing and new methodological strategies in combination with modern technologies.",

Tested in a cluster-randomized controlled trial, the intervention significantly reduced self-reported intercourse and unprotected intercourse during a 12-month follow-up period. PURPOSE: The present analyses were conducted to identify moderators of the intervention's efficacy as well as, which theory-based variables mediated the intervention's effects. METHODS: Intervention efficacy over the 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up was tested using generalized estimating equation models. RESULTS: Living with their father in the home, parental strictness, and religiosity moderated the efficacy of the intervention in reducing unprotected intercourse. Self-efficacy to avoid risky situations and expected parental disapproval of their having intercourse, derived from Social Cognitive Theory, significantly mediated the intervention's effect on abstinence. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to demonstrate that Social Cognitive variables mediate the efficacy of a sexual risk-reduction intervention among South African adolescents.",

        "abstract": "We previously reported the detection of genotype P[19] rotavirus strains from children hospitalized with acute dehydrating diarrhea during a 5-year surveillance period in Taiwan. The characterization of five P[19] strains (0.4% of all typed), including three G3P[19], a novel G5P[19], and a unique G9P[19] genotype is described in this study. Phylogenetic analysis of the VP4, VP7, VP6, and NSP4 genes was performed, which demonstrated novel lineages for respective genotypes of the VP4 and the VP7 genes. The sequence similarities of the P[19] VP4 gene among Taiwanese human strains was higher (nt, 91.5-96.2%; aa, 93.7-97.6%) than to other P[19] strains (nt, 83.5-86.6%; aa, 89.4-94.1%) from different regions of the world. The VP7 gene of the three G3P[19] Taiwanese strains shared up to 93.4% nt and 97.5% aa identity to each other but had lower similarity to reference strain sequences available in GenBank (nt, <90.1%; aa, <95.6%). Similarly, the VP7 gene of the novel G5P[19] strain was only moderately related to the VP7 gene of reference G5 strains (nt, 82.2-87.3%; aa, 87.0-93.1%), while the VP7 gene of the single G9P[19] strain was genetically distinct from other known human and animal G9 rotavirus strains (nt, </=92.0%; aa, </=95.7%). Together, these findings suggest that the Taiwanese P[19] strains originated by independent interspecies transmission events. Synchronized surveillance of human and animal rotaviruses in Taiwan should identify possible hosts of these uncommon human rotavirus strains. J. Med. Virol. 83:1279-1287, 2011.

        "abstract": "Coxiella burnetii is a zoonotic pathogen that causes Q fever in humans and is transmitted primarily from infected goats, sheep, or cows. Q fever typically presents as an acute febrile illness; however, individuals with certain predisposing conditions, including cardiac valvulopathy, are at risk for chronic Q fever, a serious manifestation that may present as endocarditis. In response to a cluster of Q fever cases detected by public health surveillance, we evaluated C. burnetii infection in a community that operates a large-scale cow and goat dairy. A case was defined as an individual linked to the community with a C. burnetii phase II IgG titer >/= 128. Of 135 participants, 47 (35%) cases were identified. Contact with or close proximity to cows, goats, and their excreta was associated with being a case (relative risk 2.7, 95% confidence interval 1.3-5.3). Cases were also identified among individuals without cow or goat contact and could be related to windborne spread or tracking of C. burnetii on fomites within the community. A history of injection drug use was reported by 26/130 (20%) participants; follow-up for the presence of valvulopathy and monitoring for development of chronic Q fever may be especially important among this population.",

        "abstract": "Multilocus DNA sequencing has identified a nonarchetypal strain of Toxoplasma gondii as the causal agent of a waterborne outbreak in Brazil in 2001. The strain, isolated from a water supply epidemiologically linked to the outbreak, was virulent to mice, and it has previously been identified as BrI. Using a serologic assay that detects strain-specific antibodies, we found that 13 (65%) of 20 individuals who were immunoglobulin (Ig) M positive during the outbreak possessed the same serotype as mice infected with the purported epidemic strain. The remaining 7 individuals, plus additional IgM-negative, IgG-positive individuals, possessed 1 of 4 novel serotypes, the most common of which matched the serotype of mice infected with strains isolated from chickens foraging near the outbreak site. The latter strains likely reflect the genetic diversity of T. gondii circulating in highly endemic regions of Brazil. The serotyping assay proved a useful tool for identification of specific individuals infected with the outbreak agent.",

        "abstract": "CONTEXT: Typhoid fever in the United States has increasingly been due to infection with antimicrobial-resistant Salmonella ser Typhi. National surveillance for typhoid fever can inform prevention and treatment recommendations. OBJECTIVE: To assess trends in infections with antimicrobial-resistant S. Typhi. DESIGN: Cross-sectional, laboratory-based surveillance study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We reviewed data from 1999-2006 for 1902 persons with typhoid fever who had epidemiologic information submitted to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and 2016 S. Typhi isolates sent by participating public health laboratories to the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System Laboratory at the CDC for antimicrobial susceptibility testing. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportion of S. Typhi isolates demonstrating resistance to 14 antimicrobial agents and patient risk factors for antimicrobial-resistant infections. RESULTS: Patient median age was 22 years (range, <1-90 years); 1295 (73%) were hospitalized and 3 (0.2%) died. Foreign travel within 30 days of illness was reported by 1439 (79%). Only 58 travelers (5%) had received typhoid vaccine. Two hundred seventy-two (13%) of 2016 isolates tested were resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (multidrug-resistant S. Typhi [MDRST]); 758 (38%) were resistant to nalidixic acid (nalidixic acid-resistant S. Typhi [NARST]) and 734 NARST isolates (97%) had decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin. The proportion of NARST increased from 19% in 1999 to 54% in 2006. Five ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates were identified. Patients with resistant infections were more likely to report travel to the Indian subcontinent: 85% of patients infected with MDRST and 94% with NARST traveled to the Indian subcontinent, while 44% of those with susceptible infections did (MDRST odds ratio, 7.5; 95% confidence interval, 4.1-13.8; NARST odds ratio, 20.4; 95% confidence interval, 12.4-33.9). CONCLUSION: Infection with antimicrobial-resistant S. Typhi strains among US patients with typhoid fever is associated with travel to the Indian subcontinent, and an increasing proportion of these infections are due to S. Typhi strains with decreased susceptibility to fluoroquinolones.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recently proposed the use of hemoglobin A1c as a practical and valid strategy to identify high-risk people for whom delivery of an intensive lifestyle intervention to prevent type 2 diabetes is likely to be cost effective. PURPOSE: To estimate composite risks of developing diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD) for adults with different hemoglobin A1c test results and to compare those risks with those of adults who met the 2003 ADA definition for prediabetes. METHODS: Cross-sectional data from the 2005-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were analyzed in 2009. The method of Stern and colleagues was used to estimate the 7.5-year probability of type 2 diabetes, and the Framingham General CVD Risk Engine was used to estimate the 10-year probability of CVD for adults with different A1c results. Sample weights were used to account for sampling probability and to adjust for noncoverage and nonresponse. RESULTS: Among adults meeting the 2003 ADA definition for prediabetes, the probabilities for incident type 2 diabetes (over 7.5 years) and CVD (over 10 years) were 33.5% and 10.7%, respectively. Use of A1c alone, in the range of 5.5% to <6.5%, would identify a population with comparable risks for diabetes (32.4% [SE=1.2%]) and CVD (11.4% [SE=0.6%]). A slightly higher cutoff (>/=5.7%) would identify adults with risks of 41.3% (SE=1.5%) for diabetes and 13.3% (SE=0.8%) for CVD-risks that are comparable to people enrolled in the Diabetes Prevention Program. CONCLUSIONS: A1c-based testing in clinical settings should be considered as a means to identify greater numbers of adults at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes and CVD.",

        "abstract": "The rabies virus (RABV) glycoprotein (G) is responsible for inducing neutralizing antibodies against rabies virus. Development of recombinant vaccines using the G genes from attenuated strains rather than street viruses is a regular practice. In contrast to this scenario, we generated three human adenovirus type 5 recombinants using the G genes from the vaccine strains SRV9 and Flury-LEP, and the street RABV strain BD06 (nrAd5-SRV9-G, nrAd5-Flury-LEP-G, and nrAd5-BD06-G). These recombinants were non-replicative, but could grow up to ~108 TCID50/ml in helper HEK293AD cells. Expression of the G protein was verified by immunostaining, quantitative PCR and cytometry. Animal experiments revealed that immunization with nrAd5-BD06-G can induce a higher seroconversion rate, a higher neutralizing antibody level, and a longer survival time after rabies virus challenge in mice when compared with the other two recombinants. Moreover, the expression of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) was significantly higher in mice immunized with nrAd5-BD06-G, which might also contribute to the increased protection. These results show that the use of street RABV G for non-replicative systems may be an alternative for developing effective recombinant rabies vaccines.",

        "abstract": "The first cases of the current West African epidemic of Ebola virus disease (hereafter referred to as Ebola) were reported on March 22, 2014, with a report of 49 cases in Guinea. By August 31, 2014, a total of 3,685 probable, confirmed, and suspected cases in West Africa had been reported. To aid in planning for additional disease-control efforts, CDC constructed a modeling tool called EbolaResponse to provide estimates of the potential number of future cases. If trends continue without scale-up of effective interventions, by September 30, 2014, Sierra Leone and Liberia will have a total of approximately 8,000 Ebola cases. A potential underreporting correction factor of 2.5 also was calculated. Using this correction factor, the model estimates that approximately 21,000 total cases will have occurred in Liberia and Sierra Leone by September 30, 2014. Reported cases in Liberia are doubling every 15-20 days, and those in Sierra Leone are doubling every 30-40 days. The EbolaResponse modeling tool also was used to estimate how control and prevention interventions can slow and eventually stop the epidemic. In a hypothetical scenario, the epidemic begins to decrease and eventually end if approximately 70% of persons with Ebola are in medical care facilities or Ebola treatment units (ETUs) or, when these settings are at capacity, in a non-ETU setting such that there is a reduced risk for disease transmission (including safe burial when needed). In another hypothetical scenario, every 30-day delay in increasing the percentage of patients in ETUs to 70% was associated with an approximate tripling in the number of daily cases that occur at the peak of the epidemic (however, the epidemic still eventually ends). Officials have developed a plan to rapidly increase ETU capacities and also are developing innovative methods that can be quickly scaled up to isolate patients in non-ETU settings in a way that can help disrupt Ebola transmission in communities. The U.S. government and international organizations recently announced commitments to support these measures. As these measures are rapidly implemented and sustained, the higher projections presented in this report become very unlikely.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Over the past decade, childhood obesity has been recognized as an increasing health problem worldwide. It is a predictor of obesity during adulthood, which is strongly linked to chronic lifestyle diseases. PURPOSE: This paper aims to evaluate the effectiveness of school-based programs in the prevention and management of childhood obesity. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was undertaken for RCTs and clinical controlled trials on school-based interventions that addressed childhood obesity, published between 1995 and 2007. The papers included for the meta-analysis were those in which ORs or standardized mean differences and their 95% CIs were reported or could be calculated from available data. RESULTS: Meta-analysis showed that the odds of participants' being overweight and obese in the school-based intervention programs compared with the control arm were significantly protective in the short term (OR=0.74, 95% CI=0.60, 0.92). Interventions that were conducted for more than 1 year had a higher OR of decreasing the prevalence of obesity. However, intervention programs were not effective in decreasing BMI compared with control treatments, with a weighted mean difference of -0.62 (95% CI=-1.39, 0.14). CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis showed that there was convincing evidence that school-based interventions are effective, at least short-term, in reducing the prevalence of childhood obesity. Longer-running programs were more effective than shorter programs.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In 2010, researchers using novel laboratory techniques found that US-licensed rotavirus vaccines contain DNA or DNA fragments from Porcine circovirus (PCV), a virus common among pigs but not believed to cause illness in humans. We sought to understand pediatricians' and mothers' perspectives on this finding. METHODS: We conducted three iterations of focus groups for pediatricians and non-vaccine hesitant mothers in Seattle, WA, Cincinnati, OH, and Rochester, NY. Focus groups explored perceptions of rotavirus disease, rotavirus vaccination, and attitudes about the detection of PCV material in rotavirus vaccines. RESULTS: Pediatricians understood firsthand the success of rotavirus vaccines in preventing severe acute gastroenteritis among infants and young children. They measured this benefit against the theoretical risk of DNA material from PCV in rotavirus vaccines, determining overall that the PCV finding was of no clinical significance. Particularly influential was the realization that the large, randomized clinical trials that found both vaccines to be highly effective and safe were conducted with DNA material from PCV already in the vaccines. Most mothers supported the ideal of full disclosure regarding vaccination risks and benefits. However, with a scientific topic of this complexity, simplified information regarding PCV material in rotavirus vaccines seemed frightening and suspicious, and detailed information was frequently overwhelming. Mothers often remarked that if they did not understand a medical or technical topic regarding their child's health, they relied on their pediatrician's guidance. Many mothers and pediatricians were also concerned that persons who abstain from pork consumption for religious or personal reasons may have unsubstantiated fears of the PCV finding. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatricians considered the detection of DNA material from PCV in rotavirus vaccines a \"non-issue\" and reported little hesitation in continuing to recommend the vaccines. Mothers desired transparency, but ultimately trusted their pediatrician's recommendation. Both vaccines are currently approved for their intended use, and no risk of human PCV illness has been reported. Communicating this topic to pediatricians and mothers requires sensitivity to a broad range of technical understanding and personal concerns.",

        "abstract": "A roundtable dialogue to discuss \"NHANES Monitoring of Biomarkers of Folate and Vitamin B-12 Status\" took place in July 2010. This article provides an overview of the meeting and this supplement issue. Although the focus of the roundtable dialogue was on the measurement of folate and vitamin B-12 status biomarkers in the NHANES, this article also describes the relevance and importance of these issues for clinical and research laboratories. The roundtable identified the microbiological assay (MA) as the gold standard for measurement of serum and red blood cell folate concentrations. The roundtable noted that differences in results between the Bio-Rad Quantaphase II procedure (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) that NHANES 1991-1994 and 1999-2006 used and the MA that NHANES 2007-2010 used will require adjustment equations to evaluate time trends. The roundtable found that the close agreement between the serum results for the MA and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) procedures supported the conversion to LC-MS/MS for serum folate in future NHANES. The roundtable recognized the uncertainty about whether subclinical vitamin B-12 deficiency is a public health concern but encouraged reinstatement of at least one circulating vitamin B-12 measure and one functional vitamin B-12 status measure in future NHANES. The use of serum vitamin B-12 and plasma methylmalonic acid would provide continuity with past NHANES. The roundtable supported the continued use of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) reference materials in NHANES biomarker analyses and the further development of additional reference materials by the NIST.",

Cultural theory of risk perception suggests that social context influences one's interpretation of questionnaire items. We examined psychometric properties of job control and job demand scales with US- and foreign-born workers who preferred English, Spanish, or Chinese (n = 3,114, mean age = 58.1). Across all groups, the job control scale had acceptable Cronbach's alpha (0.78-0.83) and equivalent factor loadings (DeltaCFI < 0.01). Immigrants had low alpha (0.42-0.65) for the job demands scale regardless of language, education, or age of migration. Two job-demand items had different factor loadings across groups. Among immigrants, both scales had inconsistent associations with perceived job stress and self-rated health. For a better understanding of immigrants' job stress, the concept of job demands should be expanded and immigrants' expectations for job control explored.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Herpes zoster (HZ) vaccine was recommended in the United States to reduce HZ-associated morbidity. Vaccination may reduce HZ-associated mortality, but no strategy exists to monitor mortality trends. METHODS: We validated HZ coding on death certificates from California, using hospital records as the gold standard, and applied the results to national-level data to estimate HZ mortality. RESULTS: In the validation phase of the study, among 40 available hospital records listing HZ as the underlying cause of death, HZ was the underlying cause for 21 (52.5%) and a contributing cause for 5 (12.5%). Among 21 hospital records listing HZ as the underlying cause of death, the median age of decedents was 84 years (range 50-99); 60% had no contraindications for HZ vaccination. Of the 37 available records listing HZ as a contributing cause of death, HZ was a contributing cause for 2 (5.4%) and the underlying cause for 6 (16.2%). Nationally, in the 7 years preceding the HZ vaccination program, the average annual number of deaths in which HZ was reported as the underlying cause of death was 149; however, based on our validation study, we estimate the true number was 78 (range: 31-118). CONCLUSION: National death certificate data greatly overestimate deaths in which HZ is the underlying or contributing cause of death. The HZ vaccination program could prevent some HZ-related deaths but the impact will be difficult to assess using national mortality data.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Trichomonas vaginalis is the most prevalent nonviral sexually transmitted infection in the United States, affecting 3.1% of women of reproductive age. Infection is associated with HIV acquisition and pelvic inflammatory disease. In the United States, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines recommend testing all women with vaginal discharge for T. vaginalis, but except for HIV-infected women, there are no national guidelines for screening asymptomatic persons. The objective of this analysis is to assess testing and screening practices for T. vaginalis among symptomatic and asymptomatic women in the sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic setting. METHODS: We analyzed data on demographics, clinical presentation, and laboratory testing for all women visiting a clinician in 2010 to 2011 at any of 15 STD clinics participating in the STD Surveillance Network. Prevalence of laboratory-confirmed T. vaginalis infection was calculated among symptomatic women tested and among asymptomatic women screened. RESULTS: A total of 59,176 women visited STD clinicians: 39,979 were considered symptomatic and 19,197 were considered asymptomatic for T. vaginalis infection, whereas 211 were HIV-infected. Diagnostic practices varied by jurisdiction: 4.0% to 96.1% of women were tested or screened for T. vaginalis using any laboratory test. Among 17,952 symptomatic women tested, prevalence was 26.2%. Among 3909 asymptomatic women screened, prevalence was 6.5%. Among 92 HIV-infected women tested/screened, prevalence was 29.3%. CONCLUSIONS: Trichomoniasis is common among STD clinic patients. In this analysis, most STD clinics tested symptomatic women seeking care, in accordance with national guidelines. All HIV-infected women should be screened annually. Additional evidence and national guidance are needed regarding potential benefits of T. vaginalis screening in other asymptomatic women.",

Descriptive statistics were calculated with the categorical data, whereas thematic analysis was completed with the qualitative data. Between 2007 and 2013, PfH was disseminated to 776 individuals from 104 different organizations in 21 states/territories. The smallest proportion of trainees was physicians (6.9%). More than three-fourths of survey respondents (78.6%) reported using PfH, but less than one-third (31.8%) used the intervention with every patient. The PfH training supports the implementation of the intervention; however, challenges were experienced in clinician engagement.

        "abstract": "In regions where endemic measles virus has been eliminated, diagnostic assays are needed to assist in correctly classifying measles cases irrespective of vaccination status. A measles IgG avidity assay was configured using a commercially available measles-specific IgG enzyme immunoassay by modifying the protocol to include three 5-minute washes with diethylamine (60mM, pH 10.25) following serum incubation; serum was serially diluted and results were expressed as end-titer avidity index. Receiver Operating Characteristic analysis was used for evaluation and validation, and to establish low (</= 30%) and high (>/= 70%) end-titer avidity thresholds. Analysis of 319 serum specimens expected to contain either high or low avidity antibodies per clinical and epidemiological data indicated that this assay is highly accurate with an Area Under the Curve of 0.998 (95% CI: 0.978-1.000), sensitivity of 91.9% (95%CI: 83.2%-97.0%) and specificity of 98.4% (95%CI: 91.6%-100%). This assay is rapid (<2 hours) and precise (SD: 4%-7%). In 18 samples from an elimination setting outbreak, the assay identified 2 acute measles cases with low avidity results; both were IgM positive samples. Additionally, 11 patients (15 samples) with modified measles that were found to have high avidity IgG results were classified as secondary vaccine failures; one sample with an intermediate avidity result was not interpretable. In elimination settings, measles IgG avidity assays can complement existing diagnostic tools in confirming unvaccinated acute cases and, in conjunction with adequate clinical and epidemiologic investigation, aid in the classification of vaccine failure cases.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dengue viruses (DENVs) infect >300 million people annually, causing 96 million cases of dengue disease and 22 000 deaths. A safe vaccine that protects against DENV disease is a global health priority. METHODS: We enrolled 72 flavivirus-naive healthy adults in a phase 1 double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled dose-escalation trial (low and high dose) of a live attenuated recombinant tetravalent dengue vaccine candidate (TDV) given in 2 doses 90 days apart. Volunteers were followed for safety, vaccine component viremia, and development of neutralizing antibodies to the 4 DENV serotypes. RESULTS: The majority of adverse events were mild, with no vaccine-related serious adverse events. Vaccinees reported injection site pain (52% vs 17%) and erythema (73% vs 25%) more frequently than placebo recipients. Low levels of TDV-serotype 2 (TDV-2), TDV-3, and TDV-4 viremia were observed after the first but not second administration of vaccine. Overall seroconversion rates and geometric mean neutralization titers after 2 doses were 84.2% and 54.1, respectively, for DENV serotype 1 (DENV-1); 92.1% and 292.8, respectively, for DENV-2; 86.8% and 32.3, respectively, for DENV-3; and 71.1% and 15.0, respectively, for DENV-4. More than 90.0% of high-dose recipients had trivalent or broader responses. CONCLUSIONS: TDV was generally well tolerated, induced trivalent or broader neutralizing antibodies to DENV in most flavivirus-naive vaccinees, and is undergoing further development.

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Epidemics of acute respiratory disease, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003, and natural disasters, such as Hurricane Katrina in 2005, have prompted planning in hospitals that offer adult critical care to increase their capacity and equipment inventory for responding to a major demand surge. However, planning at a national, state, or local level to address the particular medical resource needs of children for mass critical care has yet to occur in any coordinated way. This paper presents the consensus opinion of the Task Force regarding supplies and equipment that would be required during a pediatric mass critical care crisis. METHODS: In May 2008, the Task Force for Mass Critical Care published guidance on provision of mass critical care to adults. Acknowledging that the critical care needs of children during disasters were unaddressed by this effort, a 17-member Steering Committee, assembled by the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education with guidance from members of the American Academy of Pediatrics, convened in April 2009 to determine priority topic areas for pediatric emergency mass critical care recommendations. Steering Committee members established subcommittees by topic area and performed literature reviews of MEDLINE and Ovid databases. The Steering Committee produced draft outlines through consensus-based study of the literature and convened October 6-7, 2009, in New York, NY, to review and revise each outline. Eight draft documents were subsequently developed from the revised outlines as well as through searches of MEDLINE updated through March 2010. The Pediatric Emergency Mass Critical Care Task Force, composed of 36 experts from diverse public health, medical, and disaster response fields, convened in Atlanta, GA, on March 29-30, 2010. Feedback on each manuscript was compiled and the Steering Committee revised each document to reflect expert input in addition to the most current medical literature. TASK FORCE RECOMMENDATIONS: The Task Force endorsed the view that supplies and equipment must be available for a tripling of capacity above the usual peak pediatric intensive care unit capacity for at least 10 days. The recommended size-specific pediatric mass critical care equipment stockpile for two types of patients is presented in terms of equipment needs per ten mass critical care beds, which would serve 26 patients over a 10-day period. Specific recommendations are made regarding ventilator capacity, including the potential use of high-frequency oscillatory ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Other recommendations include inventories for disposable medical equipment, medications, and staffing levels.

        "abstract": "The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has conducted public health surveillance for healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) in dialysis facilities since the 1970s, evolving from facility-level surveys to patient-level surveillance systems. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) recently implemented incentives for all end-stage renal disease (ESRD) facilities to monitor and report patient-level quality indicators to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) in accordance with the NHSN Dialysis Event Protocol. These CMS incentives have led to a rapid increase in dialysis facility NHSN enrollment during 2012. Ongoing challenges to HAI surveillance in this setting include variability in the surveillance process, assurance of data quality, and staff time and resource requirements. Use of existing electronic health records (EHR), especially in conjunction with detection algorithms, has increasingly been shown to produce valid and reliable estimates of HAI frequency in acute care hospitals. Given the large number of dialysis facilities that are now beginning to conduct surveillance using NHSN, the typical lack of dedicated infection prevention personnel in those facilities, and the widespread use of EHR in large dialysis provider organizations, the use of EHR will probably become a cornerstone of surveillance in these settings. Implemented properly, the use of EHR to support public health surveillance has enormous potential to focus and strengthen infection prevention activities in dialysis facilities. Systematic, ongoing validation efforts will be vital to ensure that reported data are accurate, permit valid comparisons of facility performance, and effectively support improved outcomes for dialysis patients.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: In the United States, recommendations for annual influenza vaccination gradually expanded from 2004 to 2008, to include all children aged >/=6 months. The effects of these policies on vaccine uptake and influenza-associated health care encounters are unclear. The objectives of the study were to examine the annual incidence of influenza-related health care encounters and vaccine uptake among children age 6 to 59 months from 2000-2001 through 2010-2011 in Davidson County, TN. METHODS: We estimated the proportion of laboratory-confirmed influenza-related hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits by enrolling and testing children with acute respiratory illness or fever. We estimated influenza-related health care encounters by multiplying these proportions by the number of acute respiratory illness/fever hospitalizations and ED visits for county residents. We assessed temporal trends in vaccination coverage, and influenza-associated hospitalizations and ED visit rates. RESULTS: The proportion of fully vaccinated children increased from 6% in 2000-2001 to 38% in 2010-2011 (P < .05). Influenza-related hospitalizations ranged from 1.9 to 16.0 per 10 000 children (median 4.5) per year. Influenza-related ED visits ranged from 89 to 620 per 10 000 children (median 143) per year. Significant decreases in hospitalizations (P < .05) and increases in ED visits (P < .05) over time were not clearly related to vaccination trends. Influenza-related encounters were greater when influenza A(H3N2) circulated than during other years with median rates of 8.2 vs 3.2 hospitalizations and 307 vs 143 ED visits per 10 000 children, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Influenza vaccination increased over time; however, the proportion of fully vaccinated children remained <50%. Influenza was associated with a substantial illness burden particularly when influenza A(H3N2) predominated.",

These RMs can be used for quality control, monitoring of test performance, test validation, and proficiency testing of DNA-based genetic tests. To address the need for such materials, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention established the Genetic Testing Reference Material Coordination Program (GeT-RM), which works with the genetics community to improve public availability of characterized RMs for genetic testing. To date, the GeT-RM program has coordinated the characterization of publicly available genomic DNA RMs for a number of disorders, including cystic fibrosis, Huntington disease, fragile X, and several genetic conditions with relatively high prevalence in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. Genotypic information about a number of other cell lines has been collected and is also available. The present study includes the development and commutability/genotype characterization of 10 DNA samples for clinically relevant mutations or sequence variants in the following genes: MTHFR; SERPINA1; RET; BRCA1; and BRCA2. DNA samples were analyzed by 19 clinical genetic laboratories using a variety of assays and technology platforms. Concordance was 100% for all samples, with no differences observed between laboratories using different methods. All DNA samples are available from Coriell Cell Repositories and characterization information can be found on the GeT-RM website.",

        "abstract": "Public health ethics is a nascent field, emerging over the past decade as an applied field merging concepts of clinical and research ethics. Because the \"patient\" in public health is the population rather than the individual, existing principles might be weighted differently, or there might be different ethical principles to consider. This paper reviewed the evolution of public health ethics, the use of bioethics as its model, and the proposed frameworks for public health ethics through 2010. Review of 13 major public health ethics frameworks published over the past 15 years yields a wide variety of theoretical approaches, some similar foundational values, and a few similar operating principles. Coming to a consensus on the reach, purpose, and ends of public health is necessary if we are to agree on what ethical underpinnings drive us, what foundational values bring us to these underpinnings, and what operating principles practitioners must implement to make ethical decisions. If public health is distinct enough from clinical medicine to warrant its own set of ethical and philosophical underpinnings, then a decision must be made as to whether a single approach is warranted or we can tolerate a variety of equal but different perspectives.",

        "abstract": "Approximately 8% of the population in Papua New Guinea (PNG) has chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. To decrease the burden of chronic HBV infection, a national 3-dose infant hepatitis B vaccination program was implemented starting in 1989, with a birth dose (BD) added to the schedule in 1992. To assess the impact of the hepatitis B vaccination program, we conducted a serosurvey among children born after vaccine introduction. During 2012-2013, a cross-sectional stratified four-stage cluster survey was conducted to estimate hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) prevalence among children 4-6 years of age. We collected demographic data, vaccination history, and tested children for HBsAg. Of 2,133 participants, 2,130 children had vaccination data by either card or recall: 28% received a BD; 81% received >/= 3 vaccine doses. Of 2,109 children providing a blood sample, 60 (2.3%) tested positive for HBsAg. This is the largest, most geographically diverse survey of hepatitis B vaccination and HBsAg seroprevalence done in PNG. Progress has been made in PNG toward the Western Pacific Regional goal to reduce the prevalence of chronic HBV infection to < 1% by 2017 among 5-year-old children. Vaccination efforts should be strengthened, including increasing BD coverage and completing the 3-dose series.",

        "abstract": "While mass media campaigns have been shown to contribute to reductions in smoking prevalence, little research has been undertaken on the effectiveness of radio advertising as a communication medium. This is despite radio being less expensive and having greater reach than television in some low and middle income countries. We aimed to explore the potential of radio as an adjunct or alternative to televised campaigns by comparing reactions to a radio anti-smoking ad with three televised anti-smoking ads, all of which communicated the serious health consequences of smoking in an emotionally evocative way. In pre-exposure interviews, 18-59-year-old daily smokers (n = 306) were asked to listen to a particular radio time slot/watch a particular television program that they usually listened to/watched, in which the ad was broadcast. Post-exposure interviews were conducted within 3 days of exposure and measured recall, recognition, emotional and cognitive responses, and intentions to quit smoking. Findings indicate that the radio ad showed similar or slightly higher levels than a concurrently aired television ad on understanding (radio: 96%; television: 95%), believability (radio: 89%; television: 90%), concern about smoking (both 77%) and motivation to quit (radio: 51%; television: 45%), and significantly higher levels of unprompted recall (radio: 20%; television: 6%). It also compared well against two subsequent anti-smoking television ads. Emotionally evocative radio advertising may be an effective adjunct or alternative to television advertising in jurisdictions where there are substantial limits on funds available for airing these campaigns, or where the reach of radio outstrips television.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Malaria vector control in Africa depends upon effective insecticides in bed nets and indoor residual sprays. This study investigated the extent of insecticide resistance in Anopheles gambiae s.l., Anopheles gambiae s.s. and Anopheles arabiensis in western Kenya where ownership of insecticide-treated bed nets has risen steadily from the late 1990s to 2010. Temporal and spatial variation in the frequency of a knock down resistance (kdr) allele in A. gambiae s.s. was quantified, as was variation in phenotypic resistance among geographic populations of A. gambiae s.l. METHODS: To investigate temporal variation in kdr frequency, individual specimens of A. gambiae s.s. from two sentinel sites were genotyped using RT-PCR from 1996-2010. Spatial variation in kdr frequency, species composition, and resistance status were investigated in additional populations of A. gambiae s.l. sampled in western Kenya in 2009 and 2010. Specimens were genotyped for kdr as above and identified to species via conventional PCR. Field-collected larvae were reared to adulthood and tested for insecticide resistance using WHO bioassays. RESULTS: Anopheles gambiae s.s. showed a dramatic increase in kdr frequency from 1996 - 2010, coincident with the scale up of insecticide-treated nets. By 2009-2010, the kdr L1014S allele was nearly fixed in the A. gambiae s.s. population, but was absent in A. arabiensis. Near Lake Victoria, A. arabiensis was dominant in samples, while at sites north of the lake A. gambiae s.s was more common but declined relative to A. arabiensis from 2009 to 2010. Bioassays demonstrated that A. gambiae s.s. had moderate phenotypic levels of resistance to DDT, permethrin and deltamethrin while A. arabiensis was susceptible to all insecticides tested. CONCLUSIONS: The kdr L1014S allele has approached fixation in A. gambiae s.s. populations of western Kenya, and these same populations exhibit varying degrees of phenotypic resistance to DDT and pyrethroid insecticides. The near absence of A. gambiae s.s. from populations along the lakeshore and the apparent decline in other populations suggest that insecticide-treated nets remain effective against this mosquito despite the increase in kdr allele frequency. The persistence of A. arabiensis, despite little or no detectable insecticide resistance, is likely due to behavioural traits such as outdoor feeding and/or feeding on non-human hosts by which this species avoids interaction with insecticide-treated nets.",

In this article, we review the history of screening for SCD and other hemoglobinopathies, along with federal and state activities that have contributed to improved health outcomes for patients with SCD, as well as current newborn screening practices. We also chronicle the federal activities that have helped to shape and to refine laboratory screening and diagnostic proficiency. Finally, we review molecular testing strategies that have evolved and outline their possible future impacts on disease detection and outcome improvement.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: During the first wave of pandemic H1N1 influenza in 2009, most cases outside North America occurred in the UK. The clinical characteristics of UK patients hospitalised with pandemic H1N1 infection and risk factors for severe outcome are described. Methods A case note-based investigation was performed of patients admitted with confirmed pandemic H1N1 infection. RESULTS: From 27 April to 30 September 2009, 631 cases from 55 hospitals were investigated. 13% were admitted to a high dependency or intensive care unit and 5% died; 36% were aged <16 years and 5% were aged >/=65 years. Non-white and pregnant patients were over-represented. 45% of patients had at least one underlying condition, mainly asthma, and 13% received antiviral drugs before admission. Of 349 with documented chest x-rays on admission, 29% had evidence of pneumonia, but bacterial co-infection was uncommon. Multivariate analyses showed that physician-recorded obesity on admission and pulmonary conditions other than asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were associated with a severe outcome, as were radiologically-confirmed pneumonia and a raised C-reactive protein (CRP) level (>/=100 mg/l). 59% of all in-hospital deaths occurred in previously healthy people. CONCLUSIONS: Pandemic H1N1 infection causes disease requiring hospitalisation of previously fit individuals as well as those with underlying conditions. An abnormal chest x-ray or a raised CRP level, especially in patients who are recorded as obese or who have pulmonary conditions other than asthma or COPD, indicate a potentially serious outcome. These findings support the use of pandemic vaccine in pregnant women, children <5 years of age and those with chronic lung disease.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Modification of tobacco curing methods and other changes in cigarette manufacturing techniques could substantially reduce the levels of tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNA), a group of potent carcinogens, in cigarette smoke. In 1999, two major US cigarette manufacturers stated their intent to move towards using tobaccos low in TSNA. There is no information available on current TSNA levels in tobacco of various cigarettes available in the US, particularly in the newer varieties introduced over the past decade. METHODS: Seventeen brands of cigarettes were purchased in April of 2010 from retail stores in Minnesota. TSNA levels were measured in the tobacco filler and smoke of these cigarettes. RESULTS: In all brands, the sum of two potent carcinogenic TSNA--4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone and N'-nitrosonornicotine--in cigarette filler averaged 2.54 (+/- 1.05) mcg/g tobacco. This value is virtually identical to the sum of these two carcinogens reported for the tobacco of a US filtered cigarette in 1979. TSNA levels in smoke positively correlated with those in tobacco filler of the same cigarettes. CONCLUSION: We found no indication that any meaningful attempt was made to reduce or at least control TSNA levels in the new varieties of the popular brands Marlboro and Camel introduced over the last decade. In light of the recently granted regulatory authority to the FDA over tobacco products, regulation of TSNA levels in cigarette tobacco should be strongly considered to reduce the levels of these potent carcinogens in cigarette smoke.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of a monovalent intranasal 2009 A/H1N1 live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) were evaluated in children and adults. METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies were completed in children (2-17 y) and adults (18-49 y). Subjects were assigned 4ratio1 to receive 2 doses of H1N1 LAIV or placebo 28 days apart. The primary safety endpoint was fever >/=38.3 degrees C during days 1-8 after the first dose; the primary immunogenicity endpoint was the proportion of subjects experiencing a postdose seroresponse. Solicited symptoms and adverse events were recorded for 14 days after each dose and safety data were collected for 180 days post-final dose. In total, 326 children (H1N1 LAIV, n = 261; placebo, n = 65) and 300 adults (H1N1 LAIV, n = 240; placebo, n = 60) were enrolled. After dose 1, fever >/=38.3 degrees C occurred in 4 (1.5%) pediatric vaccine recipients and 1 (1.5%) placebo recipient (rate difference, 0%; 95% CI: -6.4%, 3.1%). No adults experienced fever following dose 1. Seroresponse rates in children (H1N1 LAIV vs. placebo) were 11.1% vs. 6.3% after dose 1 (rate difference, 4.8%; 95% CI: -9.6%, 13.8%) and 32.0% vs. 14.5% after dose 2 (rate difference, 17.5%; 95% CI: 5.5%, 27.1%). Seroresponse rates in adults were 6.1% vs. 0% (rate difference, 6.1%; 95% CI: -5.6%, 12.6%) and 14.9% vs. 5.6% (rate difference, 9.3%; 95% CI: -0.8%, 16.3%) after dose 1 and dose 2, respectively. Solicited symptoms after dose 1 (H1N1 LAIV vs. placebo) occurred in 37.5% vs. 32.3% of children and 41.7% vs. 31.7% of adults. Solicited symptoms occurred less frequently after dose 2 in adults and children. No vaccine-related serious adverse events occurred. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In subjects aged 2 to 49 years, two doses of H1N1 LAIV have a safety and immunogenicity profile similar to other previously studied and efficacious formulations of seasonal trivalent LAIV.

The geometry of the headform model is obtained based on computed tomography scanning of a volunteer. The segmentation and reconstruction of the headform model is performed by Mimics v16.0 (Materialise, Leuven, Belgium), which is a medical image processing software. The respirator model is obtained by scanning the surface of a 3MTM 8210 N95 respirator using a 3D digitizer and then the model is transformed by Geomagic Studio v12.0 (3D system, California, USA), a reverse engineering software. The headform model contains a soft tissue layer, a skull layer and a separate nose. The respirator model contains two layers (an inner face sealing layer and an outer layer) and a nose clip. Both the headform and respirator are modeled as solid elements and are deformable. The commercial software, LS-DYNA (LSTC, Livermore, California), is used to simulate the contact between the respirator and headform. Contact pressures and resultant deformation of the headform are investigated. Effects of respirator stiffness on contact characteristics are also studied. A Matlab (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) program is developed to calculate local gaps between the headform and respirator in the stable wearing state.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: A previously published randomized clinical trial indicated that a developmental behavioral intervention, the Early Start Denver Model (ESDM), resulted in gains in IQ, language, and adaptive behavior of children with autism spectrum disorder. This report describes a secondary outcome measurement from this trial, EEG activity. METHOD: Forty-eight 18- to 30-month-old children with autism spectrum disorder were randomized to receive the ESDM or referral to community intervention for 2 years. After the intervention (age 48 to 77 months), EEG activity (event-related potentials and spectral power) was measured during the presentation of faces versus objects. Age-matched typical children were also assessed. RESULTS: The ESDM group exhibited greater improvements in autism symptoms, IQ, language, and adaptive and social behaviors than the community intervention group. The ESDM group and typical children showed a shorter Nc latency and increased cortical activation (decreased alpha power and increased theta power) when viewing faces, whereas the community intervention group showed the opposite pattern (shorter latency event-related potential [ERP] and greater cortical activation when viewing objects). Greater cortical activation while viewing faces was associated with improved social behavior. CONCLUSIONS: This was the first trial to demonstrate that early behavioral intervention is associated with normalized patterns of brain activity, which is associated with improvements in social behavior, in young children with autism spectrum disorder.",

        "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Despite concern about an \"epidemic,\" there are limited data on trends in prevalence of either type 1 or type 2 diabetes across US race and ethnic groups. OBJECTIVE: To estimate changes in the prevalence of type 1 and type 2 diabetes in US youth, by sex, age, and race/ethnicity between 2001 and 2009. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Case patients were ascertained in 4 geographic areas and 1 managed health care plan. The study population was determined by the 2001 and 2009 bridged-race intercensal population estimates for geographic sites and membership counts for the health plan. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Prevalence (per 1000) of physician-diagnosed type 1 diabetes in youth aged 0 through 19 years and type 2 diabetes in youth aged 10 through 19 years. RESULTS: In 2001, 4958 of 3.3 million youth were diagnosed with type 1 diabetes for a prevalence of 1.48 per 1000 (95% CI, 1.44-1.52). In 2009, 6666 of 3.4 million youth were diagnosed with type 1 diabetes for a prevalence of 1.93 per 1000 (95% CI, 1.88-1.97). In 2009, the highest prevalence of type 1 diabetes was 2.55 per 1000 among white youth (95% CI, 2.48-2.62) and the lowest was 0.35 per 1000 in American Indian youth (95% CI, 0.26-0.47) and type 1 diabetes increased between 2001 and 2009 in all sex, age, and race/ethnic subgroups except for those with the lowest prevalence (age 0-4 years and American Indians). Adjusted for completeness of ascertainment, there was a 21.1% (95% CI, 15.6%-27.0%) increase in type 1 diabetes over 8 years. In 2001, 588 of 1.7 million youth were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes for a prevalence of 0.34 per 1000 (95% CI, 0.31-0.37). In 2009, 819 of 1.8 million were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes for a prevalence of 0.46 per 1000 (95% CI, 0.43-0.49). In 2009, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes was 1.20 per 1000 among American Indian youth (95% CI, 0.96-1.51); 1.06 per 1000 among black youth (95% CI, 0.93-1.22); 0.79 per 1000 among Hispanic youth (95% CI, 0.70-0.88); and 0.17 per 1000 among white youth (95% CI, 0.15-0.20). Significant increases occurred between 2001 and 2009 in both sexes, all age-groups, and in white, Hispanic, and black youth, with no significant changes for Asian Pacific Islanders and American Indians. Adjusted for completeness of ascertainment, there was a 30.5% (95% CI, 17.3%-45.1%) overall increase in type 2 diabetes. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Between 2001 and 2009 in 5 areas of the United States, the prevalence of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes among children and adolescents increased. Further studies are required to determine the causes of these increases.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Phthalate exposures are hypothesized to increase obesity; however, prior research has been largely cross-sectional. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated associations between prenatal phthalate exposures and body mass index (BMI) at child ages 5 and 7 years. METHODS: Nine metabolites of six phthalates-di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), di-n-octyl-, di-iso-butyl-, di-n-butyl-, butylbenzyl-, and diethyl phthalates-were measured in spot urine samples collected from pregnant African-American and Dominican women during their third trimester, and from their children at ages 3 and 5 years. To reduce multiple comparison issues, we initially used principal component analysis (PCA) to identify major patterns of natural log (ln)-transformed metabolite concentrations. Height and weight were assessed at ages 5 and 7 years, and fat mass and waist circumference at age 7. Linearized generalized estimating equation analyses related maternal component scores to child anthropometric outcomes at ages 5 (n = 326) and 7 (n = 330) years. RESULTS: PCA identified a DEHP component and a non-DEHP component. In boys, higher maternal non-DEHP, but not DEHP, component scores were associated with lower BMI z-score (beta = -0.30; 95% CI: -0.50, -0.10, n = 156), lower fat percentage (beta = -1.62; 95% CI: -2.91, -0.34, n = 142), and smaller waist circumference (beta = -2.02; 95% CI: -3.71, -0.32, n = 124). No significant associations with anthropometric outcomes were seen in girls (for BMI z-score, beta = 0.07; 95% CI: -0.18, 0.31, n = 181). Interactions between sex and non-DEHP component association with outcomes were statistically significant (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to hypotheses, prenatal non-DEHP phthalate exposures were associated with lower BMI z-score, waist circumference, and fat mass in boys during early childhood.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Psychological and educational correlates of bullying have been explored extensively. However, little information is available about the link between bullying and sexual risk-taking behaviors among adolescents, though for some youth it may be that sexual risk taking emerges in response to bullying involvement. Associations for both heterosexual youth and those who identify as gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, or questioning (GLBTQ) should be considered, as should the influence of victimization exposures in other domains. Accordingly, associations among bullying, other victimization forms, and sexual risk-taking behaviors were examined among adolescents with particular consideration to sexual orientation. METHODS: A sample of 8687 high school students completed the Dane County Youth Survey, a countywide survey administered high school students from 24 schools. Participants were asked questions about their bullying involvement and sexual risk-taking behaviors (ie, engaging in casual sex and having sex while under the influence of alcohol or drugs). RESULTS: Results indicated that bullies and bully-victims were more likely to engage in casual sex and sex under the influence. In multivariate analyses, these findings held even after controlling for demographic characteristics and victimization exposures in other domains, but primarily for heterosexual youth. CONCLUSIONS: Bullies and bully-victims engaged in more sexual risk-taking behaviors, although patterns of association varied by sexual orientation. Bullying prevention programs and programs aimed at reducing unhealthy sexual practices should consider a broader stress and coping perspective and address the possible link between the stress of bullying involvement and maladaptive coping responses.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: An estimated 120,000 HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis (CM) cases occur each year in South and Southeast Asia; early treatment may improve outcomes. The World Health Organization (WHO) recently recommended screening HIV-infected adults with CD4<100 cells/mm(3) for serum cryptococcal antigen (CrAg), a marker of early cryptococcal infection, in areas of high CrAg prevalence. We evaluated CrAg prevalence and cost-effectiveness of this screening strategy in HIV-infected adults in northern and southern Vietnam. METHODS: Serum samples were collected and stored during 2009-2012 in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, from HIV-infected, ART-naive patients presenting to care in 12 clinics. All specimens from patients with CD4<100 cells/mm(3) were tested using the CrAg lateral flow assay. We obtained cost estimates from laboratory staff, clinicians and hospital administrators in Vietnam, and evaluated cost-effectiveness using WHO guidelines. RESULTS: Sera from 226 patients [104 (46%) from North Vietnam and 122 (54%) from the South] with CD4<100 cells/mm(3) were available for CrAg testing. Median CD4 count was 40 (range 0-99) cells/mm(3). Nine (4%; 95% CI 2-7%) specimens were CrAg-positive. CrAg prevalence was higher in South Vietnam (6%; 95% CI 3-11%) than in North Vietnam (2%; 95% CI 0-6%) (p = 0.18). Cost per life-year gained under a screening scenario was $190, $137, and $119 at CrAg prevalences of 2%, 4% and 6%, respectively. CONCLUSION: CrAg prevalence was higher in southern compared with northern Vietnam; however, CrAg screening would be considered cost-effective by WHO criteria in both regions. Public health officials in Vietnam should consider adding cryptococcal screening to existing national guidelines for HIV/AIDS care.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To assess the association between state per capita allocations of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) funding for HIV testing and the percentage of persons tested for HIV. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We examined data from 2 sources: 2011 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and 2010-2011 State HIV Budget Allocations Reports. Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data were used to estimate the percentage of persons aged 18 to 64 years who had reported testing for HIV in the last 2 years in the United States by state. State HIV Budget Allocations Reports were used to calculate the state mean annual per capita allocations for CDC-funded HIV testing reported by state and local health departments in the United States. DESIGN: The association between the state fixed-effect per capita allocations for CDC-funded HIV testing and self-reported HIV testing in the last 2 years among persons aged 18 to 64 years was assessed with a hierarchical logistic regression model adjusting for individual-level characteristics. MAIN OUTCOME: The percentage of persons tested for HIV in the last 2 years. RESULTS: In 2011, 18.7% (95% confidence interval = 18.4-19.0) of persons reported being tested for HIV in last 2 years (state range, 9.7%-28.2%). During 2010-2011, the state mean annual per capita allocation for CDC-funded HIV testing was $0.34 (state range, $0.04-$1.04). A $0.30 increase in per capita allocation for CDC-funded HIV testing was associated with an increase of 2.4 percentage points (14.0% vs 16.4%) in the percentage of persons tested for HIV per state. CONCLUSIONS: Providing HIV testing resources to health departments was associated with an increased percentage of state residents tested for HIV.",

        "abstract": "In some influenza surveillance systems, timely transport to laboratories for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing is challenging. Guidelines suggest that samples can be stored at 4 degrees C for up to 96 hours but the effect of longer storage times has not been systematically evaluated. We collected nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal specimens from patients in Kenya and stored them in viral transport medium at 2 to 8 degrees C before testing for influenza A and B using real-time RT-PCR. From April 2008 to November 2010, we collected 7,833 samples; 940 (12%) were positive for influenza. In multivariable analysis, specimens stored for six days were less likely to be influenza-positive compared to specimens stored between zero and one day (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 0.49, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.27-0.93). There was no statistically significant difference in influenza positivity of specimens stored for five days compared to zero to one day. There was no statistically significant relationship between days in refrigeration and cycle threshold (Ct) values for positive samples (p=0.31). We found that samples could remain in storage for at least five days without affecting the proportion-positive of samples, potentially increasing the feasibility of including influenza surveillance sites in remote areas.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: An affordable, highly immunogenic Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A meningococcal conjugate vaccine (PsA-TT) was licensed for use in sub-Saharan Africa in 2009. In 2010, Burkina Faso became the first country to implement a national prevention campaign, vaccinating 11.4 million people aged 1-29 years. We analysed national surveillance data around PsA-TT introduction to investigate the early effect of the vaccine on meningitis incidence and epidemics. METHODS: We examined national population-based meningitis surveillance data from Burkina Faso using two sources, one with cases and deaths aggregated at the district level from 1997 to 2011, and the other enhanced with results of cerebrospinal fluid examination and laboratory testing from 2007 to 2011. We compared mortality rates and incidence of suspected meningitis, probable meningococcal meningitis by age, and serogroup-specific meningococcal disease before and during the first year after PsA-TT implementation. We assessed the risk of meningitis disease and death between years. FINDINGS: During the 14 year period before PsA-TT introduction, Burkina Faso had 148 603 cases of suspected meningitis with 17 965 deaths, and 174 district-level epidemics. After vaccine introduction, there was a 71% decline in risk of meningitis (hazard ratio 0.29, 95% CI 0.28-0.30, p<0.0001) and a 64% decline in risk of fatal meningitis (0.36, 0.33-0.40, p<0.0001). We identified a statistically significant decline in risk of probable meningococcal meningitis across the age group targeted for vaccination (62%, cumulative incidence ratio [CIR] 0.38, 95% CI 0.31-0.45, p<0.0001), and among children aged less than 1 year (54%, 0.46, 0.24-0.86, p=0.02) and people aged 30 years and older (55%, 0.45, 0.22-0.91, p=0.003) who were ineligible for vaccination. No cases of serogroup A meningococcal meningitis occurred among vaccinated individuals, and epidemics were eliminated. The incidence of laboratory-confirmed serogroup A N meningitidis dropped significantly to 0.01 per 100,000 individuals per year, representing a 99.8% reduction in the risk of meningococcal A meningitis (CIR 0.002, 95% CI 0.0004-0.02, p<0.0001). INTERPRETATION: Early evidence suggests the conjugate vaccine has substantially reduced the rate of meningitis in people in the target age group, and in the general population because of high coverage and herd immunity. These data suggest that fully implementing the PsA-TT vaccine could end epidemic meningitis of serogroup A in sub-Saharan Africa. FUNDING: None.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hospital-based surveillance for pneumococcal meningitis has been conducted since January 1996 in the city of Salvador, Brazil. The purpose of this study was to describe the temporal evolution of Penicillin Non-Susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (PNSSP) in regards to serotype distributions and clonal diversity recovered from meningitis cases over 17 years. METHODS: Broth microdilution was used to identify pneumococcal isolates that were PNSSP (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration > 0.12 mug/ml). The annual incidence rate of meningitis cases was calculated. Serotyping was defined using multiplex polymerase chain reaction assays and quellung reaction. Genetic diversity of PNSSP isolates was assessed using both pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST) analyses. RESULTS: A total of 854 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture pneumococcal isolates were tested by broth microdilution method and serotyped. A total of 173 (20.3 %) were penicillin non-susceptible (PNSSP) (Minimum Inhibitory concentration >/= 0.12 mug/ml). The annual incidence of meningitis cases declined from 1.65/100,000 population (1996) to 0.2/100,000 population in 2012 and the rate due to PNSSP declined 82 % over the 17-years of surveillance. PNSSP isolates were restricted to 13 serotypes, being the most common ones serotypes14 (45.1 %; 78/173), 23 F (19.1 %; 33/173), 6B (14.4 %; 25/173), 19 F (9.2 %; 16/173) and 19A (5.2 %; 9/173). Among the PNSSP isolates, 94 % had serotypes represented in the 10-valent conjugate vaccine (PCV10). The predominant serotype 14 clonal groups were identified as PFGE group A/multilocus sequence type 66 (ST66) [35.3 % (61/173)] and PFGE group GK/ST156 [4.6 % (8/173)], the latter one associated with high level resistance to penicillin and ceftriaxone. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show sustained reductions in pneumococcal meningitis cases in the Metropolitan region of Salvador from 1996 to 2012. This might reflect a beneficial impact of conjugate vaccines. Continued surveillance and further studies need to be conducted to better understanding on PCV10 vaccine impact.",

        "abstract": "This article discusses approaches that have been used to examine potentially adverse outcomes in healthcare professionals who work with or are exposed to chemotherapy drugs: (1) the use of biomarkers to evaluate genotoxic damage; (2) adverse reproductive outcomes; and (3) the association of cancer with exposure to chemotherapy drugs. Biomarkers of exposure and effect have been used extensively to monitor both healthcare professionals who work with antineoplastic(3-5) and other hazardous drugs, and workers in other occupational settings who may be exposed to genotoxic chemicals. In general, biomarkers are based on mutagenic or other end points of genotoxicity of the drugs. As most of the first generation of antineoplastic drugs were genotoxic in one test system or another, they were ideal candidates for use in exposed worker populations. However, these end points are typically nonspecific in nature and can result from exposure to any genotoxic compound, certain types of radiation, and possibly viral infections. Therefore, studies of worker populations must be carefully designed to rule out extraneous factors such as smoking history, diet, age, and other variables that may compromise test results. Nevertheless, more than half of the 100-plus published studies in the literature have reported a statistically significant association between exposure to antineoplastic drugs and the end point being investigated. Most of these studies have originated outside the United States, and they often have been conducted in countries where safety precautions may not be as rigorous as in the United States.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Long-term follow-up of children identified through newborn screening is a critical process of data collection and analysis for advancing the public health understanding of the health outcomes and service uptake of the affected children. This article describes first steps toward the long-term follow-up of newborn screening children with confirmed disorders through records linkage using population-based administrative data. METHODS: The study cohort consisted of children born in 2006-2007 with confirmed disorders identified through newborn screening. Deterministic data linkage methods were used for record matching. RESULTS: The cohort was followed up to 2 years after birth by matching to data sources including vital records, hospital discharges, the Congenital Malformations Registry, and Early Intervention to monitor service utilization, comorbidities, and mortality of the affected children. Of 1215 children with confirmed conditions identified through newborn screening, 25 deaths (2.1%) were identified, 86.1% used hospital (in- or outpatient) services, 36.1% were enrolled in the Congenital Malformations Registry, and 19.9% used the services of the Early Intervention program during the 2-year follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term follow-up of children with disorders identified through newborn screening can be initiated by using existing administrative data. This method is an inexpensive, cost-effective. and efficient approach for periodical assessment of services utilization, the efficiency of service delivery, and health outcomes for affected individuals.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A worldwide poliomyelitis eradication program was initiated in 1988; however, strains of wild poliovirus (WPV) are still endemic in some countries. Until WPV transmission is eradicated globally, importation and outbreaks of WPV are alarming possibilities. This study is the first report to document the polio immunity after 2004, when an inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) was introduced in the Republic of Korea. METHODS: A total of 745 serum samples from randomly selected patients ranging from 6 to 84 years of age were used for neutralization tests, performed in the World Health Organization polio national reference laboratory. RESULTS: Among the 745 tested sera, 439 (58.9%) were seropositive and 19 (2.6%) were seronegative to all PV serotypes. In all age groups, PV3 showed the lowest level of seroprevalence, at 509 cases (68.3%), compared to 616 (82.7%) for PV1 and 685 (91.9%) for PV2. In the 6-10-year age group, which included IPV-immunized children, the highest seropositive rate was observed and the difference in seroprevalence between PV3 and other serotypes was the lowest compared to the other age groups immunized with oral PV vaccines (OPV). In addition, the seronegative rates of all three PV types in children aged 6-10 in this study were found to be lower than those in OPV-immunized children reported in a previous study from the Republic of Korea. Meanwhile, middle-aged subjects (41-60 years) had the lowest seroprevalence and geometric mean titer. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates a deficiency in immunity to PV in middle-aged individuals, and low seroprevalence to PV3 in all age groups. In addition, due to the ongoing risk of importing PV, middle-aged people should consider PV vaccination before visiting a PV-endemic country. Our findings provide data to assist those involved in deciding future national polio vaccination strategies for the maintenance of a polio-free status in Korea.",

However, the paperbased format of the checklist makes administration cumbersome and limits timely analysis and communication of results. DEVELOPMENT OF E-TOOL: In early 2012, the SLMTA team in Vietnam developed an electronic SLIPTA checklist tool. The e-Tool was pilot tested in Vietnam in mid-2012 and revised. It was used during SLMTA implementation in Vietnam and Cambodia in 2012 and 2013 and further revised based on auditors' feedback about usability. OUTCOMES: The SLIPTA e-Tool enabled rapid turn-around of audit results, reduced workload and language barriers and facilitated analysis of national results. Benefits of the e-Tool will be magnified with in-country scale-up of laboratory quality improvement efforts and potential expansion to other countries.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: We aimed to determine whether the patterns and trends of HIV infections newly diagnosed within correctional and noncorrectional facilities differ. METHODS: We classified persons newly diagnosed with HIV infection in the United States between 2008 and 2011 (n = 181 710) by correctional and noncorrectional facilities where diagnoses were first made, and stratified by sex, age group, race/ethnicity, transmission category, and diagnosis year. RESULTS: An estimated 9187 persons were newly diagnosed with HIV infection in 2008 to 2011 while incarcerated, representing approximately 5.1% of the 181 710 HIV infections diagnosed in the United States during this period. Of these incarcerated persons, 84% were male, 30% were aged 30 to 39 years, 59% were Black/African American, and 51% of the men had been exposed through male-to-male sexual contact. Yearly numbers of diagnoses declined by 9.9% in correctional versus 0.3% in noncorrectional facilities. The percentage with a late HIV diagnosis was significantly lower in correctional than in noncorrectional facilities (prevalence ratio = 0.52; 95% confidence interval = 0.49, 0.55). CONCLUSIONS: Initial HIV diagnosis occurred sooner after HIV infection onset in correctional than in noncorrectional settings, pointing to the need for efficient referral systems after release.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alcohol is a teratogen. Prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with a range of adverse reproductive outcomes and can cause fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) characterized by lifelong physical, behavioral, and intellectual disabilities. FASDs are completely preventable if a woman does not drink alcohol while pregnant. METHODS: CDC analyzed data from the 2011-2013 National Survey of Family Growth to generate U.S. prevalence estimates of risk for an alcohol-exposed pregnancy for 4,303 nonpregnant, nonsterile women aged 15-44 years, by selected demographic and behavioral factors. A woman was considered at risk for an alcohol-exposed pregnancy during the past month if she had sex with a male, drank any alcohol, and did not (and her partner did not with her) use contraception in the past month; was not sterile; and had a partner (or partners) not known to be sterile. RESULTS: The weighted prevalence of alcohol-exposed pregnancy risk among U.S. women aged 15-44 years was 7.3%. During a 1-month period, approximately 3.3 million women in the United States were at risk for an alcohol-exposed pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH PRACTICE: Alcohol use in pregnancy is associated with low birthweight, preterm birth, birth defects, and developmental disabilities. Women of reproductive age should be informed of the risks of alcohol use during pregnancy, and contraception should be recommended, as appropriate, for women who do not want to become pregnant. Women wanting a pregnancy should be advised to stop drinking at the same time contraception is discontinued. Health care providers should advise women not to drink at all if they are pregnant or there is any chance they might be pregnant. Alcohol misuse screening and behavioral counseling (also known as alcohol screening and brief intervention) is recommended for all adults in primary care, including reproductive-aged and pregnant women, as an evidenced-based approach to reducing alcohol consumption among persons who consume alcohol in excess of the recommended guidelines.",

        "abstract": "The final report from the WHO Commission on the social determinants of health recently noted: 'For policy, however important an ethical imperative, values alone are insufficient. There needs to be evidence on what can be done and what is likely to work in practice to improve health and reduce health inequities.' This is challenging, because understanding how to reduce health inequities between the poorest and better-off members of society may require a greater use of subgroup analysis to explore the differential effects of public health interventions. However, while this may produce evidence that is more policy relevant, the requisite subgroup analyses are often seen as tantamount to statistical malpractice. This paper considers some of the methodological problems with subgroup analysis, and its applicability to considerations of equity, using both clinical and public health examples. Finally, it suggests how policy needs for information on subgroups can be met while maintaining rigour.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Prevalence estimates from population-based surveys do not suffer from the same biases as case-report and clinic positivity data and may be better to monitor sexually transmitted disease morbidity over time. METHODS: We estimated the prevalence of Neisseria gonorrhoeae in a nationally representative sample of persons aged 14 to 39 years participating in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. RESULTS: From 1999 to 2008, the overall prevalence of gonorrhea was 0.27% (95% confidence interval, 0.13%-0.47%). In the 2005 to 2006 and 2007 to 2008 cycles, prevalence approached 0% and was based on too few positive sample persons to obtain reliable estimates. In 2004, most infections were found in 1 survey location. DISCUSSION: Given the low prevalence and geographic clustering of disease, gonorrhea estimates from national probability surveys are often imprecise and unstable. In 2008, gonorrhea testing in National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey was discontinued. Continued surveillance of gonorrhea should include case reporting and prevalence estimates from local surveys and sentinel surveillance systems.",

        "abstract": "Cable bolts are sometimes used in low-seam coal mines to provide support in difficult ground conditions. This paper describes cable bolting solutions at two low-seam coal mines in similar ground conditions. Both mines used support systems incorporating cable bolts as part of the primary support system. Two original cable bolt based support systems as well as two modified systems are evaluated to estimate their ability to prevent large roof falls. One of the support systems incorporated passive cable bolts, while the other used pre-tensioned cable bolts. The results and experience at the mines showed that the modified systems provided improved stability over the original support systems. The presence of the cable bolts is the most important contribution to stability against large roof falls, rather than the details of the support pattern. It was also found that a heavy steel channel can improve the safety of the system because of the 'sling' action it provides. Additionally, the analysis showed that fully-grouted rebar bolts load much earlier than the cable bolts, and pre-tensioning of the cable bolts can result in a more uniform distribution of loading in the roof.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: We tested whether soap presence in the home or a designated handwashing station was associated with diarrhoea and respiratory illness in Kenya. METHODS: In April 2009, we observed presence of a handwashing station and soap in households participating in a longitudinal health surveillance system in rural Kenya. Diarrhoea and acute respiratory illness (ARI) in children < 5 years old were identified using parent-reported syndromic surveillance collected January-April 2009. We used multivariate generalised linear regression to estimate differences in prevalence of illness between households with and without the presence of soap in the home and a handwashing station. RESULTS: Among 2547 children, prevalence of diarrhoea and ARI was 2.3 and 11.4 days per 100 child-days, respectively. Soap was observed in 97% of households. Children in households with soap had 1.3 fewer days of diarrhoea/100 child-days (95% CI -2.6, -0.1) than children in households without soap. ARI prevalence was not associated with presence of soap. A handwashing station was identified in 1.4% of households and was not associated with a difference in diarrhoea or ARI prevalence. CONCLUSIONS: Soap presence in the home was significantly associated with reduced diarrhoea, but not ARI, in children in rural western Kenya. Whereas most households had soap in the home, almost none had a designated handwashing station, which may prevent handwashing at key times of hand contamination.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Prescription drug abuse in the United States and elsewhere in the world is increasing at an alarming rate with non-medical opioid use, in particular, increasing to epidemic proportions over the past two decades. It is imperative to identify individuals most likely to develop opioid abuse or dependence to inform large-scale, targeted prevention efforts. METHODS: The present investigation utilized a large commercial insurance claims database to identify demographic, mental health, physical health, and healthcare service utilization variables that differentiate persons who receive an opioid abuse or dependence diagnosis within two years of filling an opioid prescription (OUDs) from those who do not receive such a diagnosis within the same time frame (non-OUDs). RESULTS: When compared to non-OUDs, OUDs were more likely to: (1) be male (59.9% vs. 44.2% for non-OUDs) and younger (M=37.9 vs. 47.7); (2) have a prescription history of more opioids (1.7 vs. 1.2), and more days supply of opioids (M=272.5, vs. M=33.2; (3) have prescriptions filled at more pharmacies (M=3.3 per year vs. M=1.3); (4) have greater rates of psychiatric disorders; (5) utilize more medical and psychiatric services; and (6) be prescribed more concomitant medications. A predictive model incorporating these findings was 79.5% concordant with actual OUDs in the data set. CONCLUSIONS: Understanding correlates of OUD development can help to predict risk and inform prevention efforts.",

        "abstract": "The objective is to estimate prevalence of parent-reported depression or anxiety among children with ASD, and describe parental concerns for their children. The design is Analysis of National Survey of Children's Health, 2003-2004. The participants are a national sample of 102,353 parents. 311,870 (544/100,000) parents of children ages 4-17 in the US reported that their child was diagnosed with autism. 125,809 also reported that their child had depression or anxiety (219/100,000). These parents report substantially higher concerns about their child's self-esteem, academic success, and potential to be bullied. Clinicians should take into account that children with ASD may face increased risk of depression or anxiety in adolescence. Coordinated care addressing social and emotional health in addition to clinical attention is important in this population.",

        "abstract": "Oxidized phospholipid species are important, biologically relevant, lipid signaling molecules that usually exist in low abundance in biological tissues. Along with their inherent stability issues, these oxidized lipids present themselves as a challenge in their detection and identification. Often times, oxidized lipid species can co-chromatograph with non-oxidized species making the detection of the former extremely difficult, even with the use of mass spectrometry. In this study, a normal-phase and reverse-phase two dimensional high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-mass spectrometric system was applied to separate oxidized phospholipids from their non-oxidized counterparts, allowing unambiguous detection in a total lipid extract. We have utilized bovine heart cardiolipin as well as commercially available tetralinoleoyl cardiolipin oxidized with cytochrome c (cyt c) and hydrogen peroxide as well as with lipoxygenase to test the separation power of the system. Our findings indicate that oxidized species of not only cardiolipin, but other phospholipid species, can be effectively separated from their non-oxidized counterparts in this two dimensional system. We utilized three types of biological tissues and oxidative insults, namely rotenone treatment of lymphocytes to induce mitochondrial damage and cell death, pulmonary inhalation exposure to single walled carbon nanotubes, as well as total body irradiation, in order to identify cardiolipin oxidation products, critical to the cell damage/cell death pathways in these tissues following cellular stress/injury. Our results indicate that selective cardiolipin (CL) oxidation is a result of a non-random free radical process. In addition, we assessed the ability of the system to identify CL oxidation products in the brain, a tissue known for its extreme complexity and diversity of CL species. The ability of the two dimensional HPLC-mass spectrometric system to detect and characterize oxidized lipid products will allow new studies to be formulated to probe the answers to biologically important questions with regard to oxidative lipidomics and cellular insult. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Oxidized phospholipids - their properties and interactions with proteins.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: In April 2009, 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) (hereafter, pH1N1) virus was identified in California, which caused widespread illness throughout the United States. We evaluated pH1N1 transmission among exposed healthcare personnel (HCP) and assessed the use and effectiveness of personal protective equipment (PPE) early in the outbreak. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: Two hospitals and 1 outpatient clinic in Southern California during March 28-April 24, 2009. PARTCIPANTS: Sixty-three HCP exposed to 6 of the first 8 cases of laboratory-confirmed pH1N1 in the United States. METHODS: Baseline and follow-up questionnaires were used to collect demographic, epidemiologic, and clinical data. Paired serum samples were obtained to test for pH1N1-specific antibodies by microneutralization and hemagglutination-inhibition assays. Serology results were compared with HCP work setting, role, and self-reported PPE use. RESULTS: Possible healthcare-associated pH1N1 transmission was identified in 9 (14%) of 63 exposed HCP; 6 (67%) of 9 seropositive HCP had asymptomatic infection. The highest attack rates occurred among outpatient HCP (6/19 [32%]) and among allied health staff (eg, technicians; 8/33 [24%]). Use of mask or N95 respirator was associated with remaining seronegative ([Formula: see text]). Adherence to PPE recommendations for preventing transmission of influenza virus and other respiratory pathogens was inadequate, particularly in outpatient settings. CONCLUSIONS: pH1N1 transmission likely occurred in healthcare settings early in the pandemic associated with inadequate PPE use. Organizational support for a comprehensive approach to infectious hazards, including infection prevention training for inpatient- and outpatient-based HCP, is essential to improve HCP and patient safety.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess the risk of pertussis by time since vaccination in children in Minnesota and Oregon who received 5 doses of acellular pertussis vaccines (DTaP). METHODS: These cohort analyses included Minnesota and Oregon children born between 1998 and 2003 who had 5 DTaP doses recorded in state Immunization Information Systems. Immunization records and statewide pertussis surveillance data were combined. Incidence rates and risk ratios for pertussis were calculated for the 6 years after receipt of the fifth DTaP dose. RESULTS: The cohorts included 224,378 Minnesota children and 179,011 from Oregon; 458 and 89 pertussis cases were identified in Minnesota and Oregon, respectively. Pertussis incidence rates rose each year of follow-up: 15.6/100,000 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 11.1-21.4) at year 1 to 138.4/100,000 (CI: 113.3-166.9) at year 6 (Minnesota); 6.2/100,000 (CI: 3.3-10.6) in year 1 to 24.4/100,000 (CI: 15.0-37.8) in year 6 (Oregon). Risk ratios increased from 1.9 (CI: 1.3-2.9) in year 2 to 8.9 (CI: 6.0-13.0) in year 6 (Minnesota) and from 1.3 (CI: 0.6-2.8) in year 2 to 4.0 (CI: 1.9-8.4) in year 6 (Oregon). CONCLUSIONS: This evaluation reports steady increase in risk of pertussis in the years after completion of the 5-dose DTaP series. This rise is likely attributable in part to waning immunity from DTaP vaccines. Continuing to monitor disease burden and vaccine effectiveness in fully vaccinated children in coming years will be important to assess ongoing risk as additional cohorts vaccinated solely with acellular pertussis vaccines are introduced.",

        "abstract": "Evidence demonstrates that scale-up of HIV services has produced stronger health systems and, conversely, that stronger health systems were critical to the success of the HIV scale-up. Increased access to and effectiveness of HIV treatment and care programs, attention to long-term sustainability, and recognition of the importance of national governance, and country ownership of HIV programs have resulted in an increased focus on structures that compromise the broader health system. Based on a review published literature and expert opinion, the article proposes 4 key health systems strengthening issues as a means to promote sustainability and country ownership of President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief and other global health initiatives. First, development partners need provide capacity building support and to recognize and align resources with national government health strategies and operational plans. Second, investments in human capital, particularly human resources for health, need to be guided by national institutions and supported to ensure the training and retention of skilled, qualified, and relevant health care providers. Third, a range of financing strategies, both new resources and improved efficiencies, need to be pursued as a means to create more fiscal space to ensure sustainable and self-reliant systems. Finally, service delivery models must adjust to recent advancements in areas of HIV prevention and treatment and aim to establish evidence-based delivery models to reduce HIV transmission rates and the overall burden of disease. The article concludes that there needs to be ongoing efforts to identify and implement strategic health systems strengthening interventions and address the inherent tension and debate over investments in health systems.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Few prospective studies have examined quantitative cigarette consumption and smoking cessation on sudden cardiac death (SCD) risk with long-term follow-up. METHODS AND RESULTS: We prospectively examined the association between cigarette smoking and smoking cessation on the risk of SCD among 101,018 women participating in the Nurses' Health Study without known coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke and cancer at baseline 1980. During 30 years of follow-up, we identified 351 SCD events. Compared to never smokers, current smokers had a 2.44-fold (95% CI, 1.80-3.31) increased risk of SCD after controlling for coronary risk factors. In multivariable analyses, quantity of cigarettes smoked daily (P for trend, <0.0001) and smoking duration (P for trend, <0.0001) were linearly associated with SCD risk among current smokers. Small to moderate amounts of cigarette consumption (1-14 per day) were associated with a significant 1.84-fold (95% CI, 1.16-2.92) increase in SCD risk and every 5 years of continued smoking was associated with an 8% increase in SCD risk (HR 1.08; 95% CI, 1.05-1.12, p<0.0001). The SCD risk linearly decreased over time after quitting and was equivalent to that of a never smoker after 20 years of cessation (p for trend <0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: In this large prospective cohort of women without CHD at baseline, a strong dose response relationship between cigarette smoking and SCD risk was observed, and smoking cessation significantlyreduced and eventually eliminated excess SCD risk. This suggests efforts to prevent SCD among women should include aggressive strategies for smoking cessation.",

        "abstract": "Clinical infection by hepatitis A virus (HAV) is generally self-limited but in some cases can progress to liver failure. Here, an HAV outbreak investigation among children with acute liver failure in a highly endemic country is presented. In addition, a sensitive method for HAV whole genome amplification and sequencing suitable for analysis of clinical samples is described. In this setting, two fatal cases attributed to acute liver failure and two asymptomatic cases living in the same household were identified. In a second household, one HAV case was observed with jaundice which resolved spontaneously. Partial molecular characterization showed that both households were infected by HAV subtype IA; however, the infecting strains in the two households were different. The HAV outbreak strains recovered from all cases grouped together within cluster IA1, which contains closely related HAV strains from the United States commonly associated with international travelers. Full-genome HAV sequences obtained from the household with the acute liver failure cases were related (genetic distances ranging from 0.01% to 0.04%), indicating a common-source infection. Interestingly, the strain recovered from the asymptomatic household contact was nearly identical to the strain causing acute liver failure. The whole genome sequence from the case in the second household was distinctly different from the strains associated with acute liver failure. Thus, infection with almost identical HAV strains resulted in drastically different clinical outcomes.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A sentinel hospital-based severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) surveillance system was established in Indonesia in 2013. Deciding on the number, geographic location and hospitals to be selected as sentinel sites was a challenge. Based on the recently published WHO guideline for influenza surveillance (2012), this study presents the process for hospital sentinel site selection. METHODS: From the 2,165 hospitals in Indonesia, the first step was to shortlist to hospitals that had previously participated in respiratory disease surveillance systems and had acceptable surveillance performance history. The second step involved categorizing the shortlist according to five regions in Indonesia to maximize geographic representativeness. A checklist was developed based on the WHO recommended attributes for sentinel site selection including stability, feasibility, representativeness and the availability of data to enable disease burden estimation. Eight hospitals, a maximum of two per geographic region, were visited for checklist administration. Checklist findings from the eight hospitals were analyzed and sentinel sites selected in the third step. RESULTS: Six hospitals could be selected based on resources available to ensure system stability over a three-year period. For feasibility, all eight hospitals visited had mechanisms for specimen shipment and the capacity to report surveillance data, but two had limited motivation for system participation. For representativeness, the eight hospitals were geographically dispersed around Indonesia, and all could capture cases in all age and socio-economic groups. All eight hospitals had prerequisite population data to enable disease burden estimation. The two hospitals with low motivation were excluded and the remaining six were selected as sentinel sites. CONCLUSIONS: The multi-step process enabled sentinel site selection based on the WHO recommended attributes that emphasize right-sizing the surveillance system to ensure its stability and maximizing its geographic representativeness. This experience may guide other countries interested in adopting WHO's influenza surveillance standards for sentinel site selection.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: As rotavirus vaccine is introduced into routine childhood immunization programs in Africa, understanding its impact on diarrheal disease burden is important. The objective of this analysis was to determine whether routinely collected health information on national diarrhea hospitalizations, in-hospital deaths and outpatient visits would be useful to monitor rotavirus vaccine impact. METHODS: We analyzed data for all-cause, nonbloody diarrheal disease among children <5 years of age from the routine health management information system (HMIS) in Rwanda from January 2008 through December 2011. We described trends in absolute numbers of inpatient admissions, in-hospital deaths and outpatient visits by year, age and setting. RESULTS: All-cause, nonbloody diarrheal hospitalizations and outpatient visits among children <5 years of age in Rwanda from 2008 to 2011 peaked during the June to August dry season, coinciding with the rotavirus season. The bulk of the diarrheal disease burden occurred in children <1 year of age. Health centers provided many care to children with diarrhea including 60-72% of hospitalizations and 97-99% of outpatient visits. Many in-hospital diarrheal deaths (84%) occurred in district hospitals. DISCUSSION: Given the stable and consistent trends and the prominent seasonality consistent with that of rotavirus, HMIS data should provide a useful baseline to monitor rotavirus vaccine impact on the overall diarrheal disease burden in Rwanda. Active, sentinel surveillance for rotavirus diarrhea will help interpret changes in diarrheal disease trends following vaccine introduction. Other countries planning rotavirus vaccine introduction should explore the availability and quality of their HMIS data.",

        "abstract": "Limited information is available to describe the molecular epidemiology of HIV-1 in Bulgaria. To better understand the genetic diversity and the epidemiologic dynamics of HIV-1 we analyzed 125 new polymerase (pol) sequences from Bulgarians diagnosed through 2009 and 77 pol sequences available from our previous study from persons infected prior to 2007. Epidemiologic and demographic information was obtained from each participant and phylogenetic analysis was used to infer HIV-1 evolutionary histories. 120 (59.5%) persons were infected with one of five different HIV-1 subtypes (A1, B, C, F1 and H) and 63 (31.2%) persons were infected with one of six different circulating recombinant forms (CRFs; 01_AE, 02_AG, 04_cpx, 05_DF, 14_BG, and 36_cpx). We also for the first time identified infection with two different clusters of unique A-like and F-like sub-subtype variants in 12 persons (5.9%) and seven unique recombinant forms (3.5%), including a novel J/C recombinant. While subtype B was the major genotype identified and was more prevalent in MSM and increased between 2000-2005, most non-B subtypes were present in persons >/=45 years old. CRF01_AE was the most common non-B subtype and was higher in women and IDUs relative to other risk groups combined. Our results show that HIV-1 infection in Bulgaria reflects the shifting distribution of genotypes coincident with the changing epidemiology of the HIV-1 epidemic among different risk groups. Our data support increased public health interventions targeting IDUs and MSM. Furthermore, the substantial and increasing HIV-1 genetic heterogeneity, combined with fluctuating infection dynamics, highlights the importance of sustained and expanded surveillance to prevent and control HIV-1 infection in Bulgaria.",

        "abstract": "Patients with influenza release aerosol particles containing the virus into their environment. However, the importance of airborne transmission in the spread of influenza is unclear, in part because of a lack of information about the infectivity of the airborne virus. The purpose of this study was to determine the amount of viable influenza A virus that was expelled by patients in aerosol particles while coughing. Sixty-four symptomatic adult volunteer outpatients were asked to cough 6 times into a cough aerosol collection system. Seventeen of these participants tested positive for influenza A virus by viral plaque assay (VPA) with confirmation by viral replication assay (VRA). Viable influenza A virus was detected in the cough aerosol particles from 7 of these 17 test subjects (41%). Viable influenza A virus was found in the smallest particle size fraction (0.3 mum to 8 mum), with a mean of 142 plaque-forming units (SD 215) expelled during the 6 coughs in particles of this size. These results suggest that a significant proportion of patients with influenza A release small airborne particles containing viable virus into the environment. Although the amounts of influenza A detected in cough aerosol particles during our experiments were relatively low, larger quantities could be expelled by influenza patients during a pandemic when illnesses would be more severe. Our findings support the idea that airborne infectious particles could play an important role in the spread of influenza.",

Her symptoms began on December 5. One day before symptom onset, she had participated in a drumming event at a community organization's building where animal-hide drums of multiple ages and origins were played. This report describes the case and subsequent investigation, which identified 84 persons potentially exposed to anthrax, including those persons at the drumming event and those who lived or worked at the event site. Review of New Hampshire disease surveillance data and clinical microbiology records for periods before and after the event identified no additional anthrax cases. Initial qualitative environmental testing of the event site yielded three positive samples (two from drum heads and one composite sample of three electrical outlets in the main drumming room). Wider, targeted, semi-quantitative environmental testing of the site and additional drums yielded six positive samples (two from one drum and four from environmental locations in the building). These results suggested that aerosolization of spores from drumheads had occurred. All isolates obtained from environmental and drum samples matched the patient's isolate by multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis using eight loci (MLVA-8). Public health agencies and persons with exposure to animal-hide drums should be aware of the potential, although remote, risk for anthrax exposure associated with these drums.",

As surveillance data are lacking in many countries, there is substantial uncertainty regarding actual incidence. M. bovis is most often not identified, as the diagnosis of TB is made by smear microscopy alone or using egg-containing culture media lacking pyruvate. Where human M. bovis cases have been studied in the region, they appear to be associated with ingestion of unpasteurized dairy products, or with airborne acquired infection in animal keepers and meat industry workers from countries where bovine TB remains a problem. Human-to-human transmission of M. bovis does occur, but appears to account for a very small proportion of cases. Efforts to eradicate M. bovis in humans in the Americas should therefore be directed at eradicating the disease in cattle, increasing pasteurization of dairy products and providing education about the dangers of consuming unpasteurized dairy products.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Laboratory testing is a fundamental component of influenza surveillance for detecting novel strains with pandemic potential and informing biannual vaccine strain selection. The United States (U.S.) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), under the auspices of its WHO Collaborating Center for Influenza, is one of the major public health agencies which provides support globally to build national capacity for influenza surveillance. Our main objective was to determine if laboratory assessments supported capacity building efforts for improved global influenza surveillance. METHODS: In 2010, 35 national influenza laboratories were assessed in 34 countries, using a standardized tool. Post-assessment, each laboratory received a report with a list of recommendations for improvement. Uptake of recommendations were reviewed 3.2 mean years after the initial assessments and categorized as complete, in-progress, no action or no update. This was a retrospective study; follow-up took place through routine project management rather than at a set time-point post-assessment. WHO data on National Influenza Centre (NIC) designation, External Quality Assessment Project (EQAP) participation and FluNet reporting was used to measure laboratory capacity longitudinally and independently of the assessments. All data was further stratified by World Bank country income category. RESULTS: At follow-up, 81 % of 614 recommendations were either complete (350) or in-progress (145) for 32 laboratories (91 % response rate). The number of countries reporting to FluNet and the number of specimens they reported annually increased between 2005, when they were first funded by CDC, and 2010, the assessment year (p < 0.01). Improvements were also seen in EQAP participation and NIC designation over time and more so for low and lower-middle income countries. CONCLUSIONS: Assessments using a standardized tool have been beneficial to improving laboratory-based influenza surveillance. Specific recommendations helped countries identify and prioritize areas for improvement. Data from assessments helped CDC focus its technical assistance by country and region. Low and lower-middle income countries made greater improvements in their laboratories compared with upper-middle income countries. Future research could include an analysis of annual funding and technical assistance by country. Our approach serves as an example for capacity building for other diseases.",

        "abstract": "Peak sound pressure level measurements conducted at indoor firing ranges ranged from 157-168 decibels (dB). Exposure to high-intensity impulsive noise during target shooting at indoor firing ranges has been identified as a significant contributor to noise-induced hearing loss among shooters. In addition, firing ranges that are constructed with adjacent areas or housed within a larger building structure require minimal sound transmission to occur outside the firing range. Several principles of noise control engineering can be applied to improve the absorption of impulse noise inside the firing ranges and limit the transmission of such impulses to adjacent areas and spaces. Although little can be done to control the direct exposure of shooters to the firing of their own firearms, several noise control solutions are presented to reduce the secondary exposure off reflected surfaces and from other shooters. This paper will provide a general overview of noise control solutions aimed to improve sound absorption inside the firing range and reduce the transmission of airborne and structuralborne sounds to adjacent areas and facilities. 2010 Institute of Noise Control Engineering.",

        "abstract": "Developmental signals that control growth and differentiation are regulated by environmental factors that generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and alter steady-state redox environments in tissues and fluids. Protein thiols are selectively oxidized and reduced in distinct spatial and temporal patterns in conjunction with changes in glutathione/glutathione disulfide (GSH/GSSG) and cysteine/cystine (Cys/CySS) redox potentials (E(h)) to regulate developmental signaling. The purpose of this study was to measure compartment-specific thiol redox status in cultured organogenesis-stage rat conceptuses and to evaluate the impact of thiol oxidation on the redox proteome. The visceral yolk sac (VYS) has the highest initial (0 h) total intracellular GSH (GSH+2GSSG) concentration (5.5 mM) and the lowest Eh (-223 mV) as determined by HPLC analysis. Total embryo (EMB) GSH concentrations ranged lower (3.2 mM) and were only slightly more oxidized than the VYS. Total GSH concentrations in yolk sac fluid (YSF) and amniotic fluid (AF) are >500-fold lower than in tissues and are highly oxidized (YSF E(h)=-121 mV and AF E(h)=-49 mV). Steady-state total Cys concentrations (Cys+2CySS) were significantly lower than GSH in tissues but were otherwise equal in VYS and EMB near 0.5 mM. On gestational day 11, total GSH and Cys concentrations in EMB and VYS increase significantly over the 6h time course while E(h) remains relatively constant. The Eh (GSH/GSSG) in YSF and AF become more reduced over time while E(h) (Cys/CySS) become more oxidized. Addition of L-buthionine-S,R-sulfoximine (BS0) to selectively inhibit GSH synthesis and mimic the effects of some GSH-depleting environmental chemicals significantly decreased VYS and EMB GSH and Cys concentrations and increased Eh over the 6h exposure period, showing a greater overall oxidation. In the YSF, BSO caused a significant increase in total Cys concentrations to 1.7 mM but did not significantly change the E(h) for Cys/CySS. A significant net oxidation was seen in the BSO-treated AF compartment after 6 h. Biotinylated iodoacetamide (BIAM) labeling of proteins revealed the significant thiol oxidation of many EMB proteins following BSO treatment. Quantitative changes in the thiol proteome, associated with developmentally relevant pathways, were detected using isotope coded affinity tag (ICAT) labeling and mass spectroscopy. Adaptive pathways were selectively enriched with increased concentrations of proteins involved in mRNA processing (splicesome) and mRNA stabilization (glycolysis, GAPDH), as well as protein synthesis (aminoacyl-tRNA) and protein folding (antigen processing, Hsp70, protein disulfide isomerase). These results show the ability of chemical and environmental modulators to selectively alter compartmental intracellular and extracellular GSH and Cys concentrations and change their corresponding E(h) within the intact viable conceptus. The altered E(h) were also of sufficient magnitude to alter the redox proteome and change relative protein concentrations, suggesting that the mechanistic links through which environmental factors inform and regulate developmental signaling pathways may be discovered using systems developmental biology techniques.",

        "abstract": "Many injuries common to all mines, mine locations and commodities can be identified and their most prominent attributes highlighted through ranked lists by frequency. In the absence of more detailed, cause-specific incidence rates, such rankings can reveal general trends of mine injuries and classify them by nature, accident type and class. Most frequently injured miners by age group, activity, and job title can provide valuable indicators not only of hazards and the problems that contribute to them, but also potential solutions. From the miner&#8217;s point of view, training, task and mine design, job hazard analysis, personal protective equipment and a variety of related measures can provide prevention for each such group of injuries on a one-by-one basis. For more systematic and long-term preventive results, research is often valuable in identifying solutions common to large groups of injuries. In particular, the patterns highlighted above provide a focal point for research, mine planning and safety and health and the continued reduction of risk for U.S. miners. In addition, groups of injuries with common causes provide useful baselines for evaluating the effectiveness of interventions. A general engineering control that facilitates safe operation of a mining machine, for example, can be evaluated using a pre- and post-intervention design. Such controls can then be evaluated using MSHA surveillance data, without developing costly reporting systems. Further work is planned to investigate those groups of injuries displaying the largest differences between underground and surface.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Federal recommendations for providing quality family planning services were published in 2014 and included preconception care (PCC). This paper aims to describe the prevalence of PCC delivery among publicly funded clinics, prior to the recommendations. METHODS: Prevalence of providing occasional or frequent PCC in the last 3 months and having written protocols for recommended PCC screenings were estimated in 2015 using survey data collected from a nationally representative sample of publicly funded clinic administrators (2013-2014, N=1,615). Analyses included examination of differential distributions of outcomes by clinic characteristics (p<0.05) and multivariable regression. RESULTS: Prevalence of occasional or frequent PCC delivery was 81% for women and 38% for men. The percentage of clinics with written protocols for specific PCC screenings ranged from 74% to 88% (women) and 66% to 83% (men). Prevalence of having written protocols for all PCC screenings was 29% for women and 22% for men. Characteristics negatively associated with having written protocols for all PCC screenings for women and men (respectively) were as follows: not receiving Title X funding (adjusted prevalence ratio [APR]=0.6, 95% CI=0.50, 0.76; APR=0.6, 95% CI=0.47, 0.77) and being a community health center (APR=0.5, 95% CI=0.37, 0.72; APR=0.5, 95% CI=0.30, 0.67); health department (APR=0.7, 95% CI=0.61, 0.87; APR=0.6, 95% CI=0.49, 0.76); or hospital/other (APR=0.6, 95% CI=0.50, 0.79; APR=0.6, 95% CI=0.43, 0.75) (versus Planned Parenthood). CONCLUSIONS: Provision of PCC appears to differ by clinic characteristics and by interpretation of the phrase \"preconception care,\" suggesting opportunities for education and improvement.",

        "abstract": "Objectives Perinatal mortality prevention strategies that target fetal deaths often utilize vital records data sets shown to contain critical quality deficiencies. To understand the causes of deficient data, we linked survey responses of fetal death reporters with facility fetal death data quality indicators. Methods In 2011, we surveyed the person most responsible for fetal death reporting at New York City healthcare facilities on their attitudes, barriers, and practices regarding reporting. We compared responses by 2 facility data quality indicators (data completeness and ill-defined cause of fetal death) for third trimester fetal death registrations using Chi squared tests. Results Thirty-nine of 50 facilities completed full questionnaires (78 % response rate); responding facilities reported 84 % (n = 11,891) of all 2011 fetal deaths, including 329 third trimester fetal deaths. Facilities citing ≥1 reporting barrier were approximately five times more likely to have incomplete third trimester registrations than facilities citing no substantial barriers (37.5 vs 7.9 %; RR 4.7; 95 % CI [1.6–14.2]). Reported barriers included onerous reporting requirements (n = 10; 26 %) and competing physician priorities (n = 11; 28 %). Facilities citing difficulty involving physicians in reporting were more likely to report fetal deaths with nonspecific cause-of-death information (70.9 vs 56.6 %; RR 1.3; 95 % CI [1.1–1.5]). Conclusions Self-reported challenges correlate with completeness and accuracy of reported fetal death data, suggesting that such barriers are likely contributing to low quality data. We identified several improvement opportunities, including in-depth training and reducing the information collected, especially for early fetal deaths (<20 weeks’ gestation), the majority of events reported. © 2015 Springer Science+Business Media New York",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES:To describe global approaches to handwashing research in low- and middle-income communities, schools and health care settings using behavioural outcome measurement and temporal study design. METHODS: Peer-reviewed and grey literature was screened for handwashing studies that evaluated behaviour change. Relevant articles were assessed by their research approach, including the investigator's selected outcome measure and time frame of various study components (e.g., formative research, intervention and evaluation). RESULTS: The initial search yielded 527 relevant articles. After application of exclusion criteria, we identified 27 unique studies (30 total articles). Of the 27 articles, most were focused in the community setting. Fifteen (56%) documented observed handwashing behaviour, while 18 (67%) used proxy measures (e.g., soap presence, diarrhoea) and 14 (52%) used self-reported behaviour. Several studies used multiple outcome measures. While all studies had an evaluation of behaviour change, there was a dearth of studies that evaluated long-term maintenance of behaviour change after the intervention's conclusion. CONCLUSIONS: While the literature is replete with a variety of handwashing studies in community, school and health care settings, none have been able to definitively document long-term behaviour change, thereby challenging the sustainability of various interventions. Additionally, there is a need to better understand which research approach is most effective in promoting long-term behaviour compliance in global low- and middle-income settings.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)'s National Tuberculosis Surveillance System (NTSS) is the national repository of tuberculosis (TB) data in the United States. Jurisdictions report to NTSS through the Report of Verified Case of Tuberculosis (RVCT) form that transitioned to a web-based system in 2009. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To improve RVCT data quality, CDC conducted a quality assurance (QA) needs assessment to develop QA strategies. These include QA components (case detection, data accuracy, completeness, timeliness, data security, and confidentiality); sample tools such as National TB Indicators Project (NTIP) to identify TB case reporting discrepancies; comprehensive training course; resource guide and toolkit. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: During July-September 2011, 73 staff from 34 (57%) of 60 reporting jurisdictions participated in QA training. Participants stated usefulness of sharing jurisdictions' QA methods; 66 (93%) wrote that the QA tools will be effective for their activities. Several jurisdictions reported implementation of QA tools pertinent to their programs. Data showed >8% increase in NTSS and NTIP enrollment through Secure Access Management Services, which monitors system usage, from August 2011-February 2012. CONCLUSIONS: Despite challenges imposed by web-based surveillance systems, QA strategies can be developed with innovation and collaboration. These strategies can also be used by other disease programs to ensure high data quality.",

        "abstract": "The link between natural disasters and subsequent fungal infections in disaster-affected persons has been increasingly recognized. Fungal respiratory conditions associated with disasters include coccidioidomycosis, and fungi are among several organisms that can cause near-drowning pneumonia. Wound contamination with organic matter can lead to post-disaster skin and soft tissue fungal infections, notably mucormycosis. The role of climate change in the environmental growth, distribution, and dispersal mechanisms of pathogenic fungi is not fully understood; however, ongoing climate change could lead to increased disaster-associated fungal infections. Fungal infections are an often-overlooked clinical and public health issue, and increased awareness by health care providers, public health professionals, and community members regarding disaster-associated fungal infections is needed.",

        "abstract": "Genes coding for nicotinic acetylcholine receptors may influence response to nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation. We examined the association of a 3' untranslated region polymorphism (rs2072661) in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor beta2 subunit (CHRNB2) gene with quitting success in response to nicotine versus placebo patch during a short-term test of patch effects. In a within-subjects cross-over design, smokers of European descent (n = 156) received 21 mg nicotine and placebo patch in counter-balanced order, during two separate 5-day simulated quit attempts, each preceded by a week of ad libitum smoking. Abstinence was assessed daily by CO < 5 ppm. Smokers with the CHRNB2 GG genotype had more days of abstinence during the nicotine versus placebo patch week compared with those with the AG or AA genotypes (P < 0.01). Moreover, nicotine patch increased the probability of quitting on the target quit day, quitting anytime during the patch week, and avoiding relapse among those with the GG genotype but not the AA/AG genotypes, although the nicotine x genotype interaction was significant only for quitting on the target quit day (P < 0.05). Regardless of patch condition, quitting on the target quit day was more likely in those with the GG genotype versus AA/AG genotypes (P < 0.05). Genetic associations were not observed for craving or withdrawal responses to nicotine versus placebo patch. These findings are consistent with previous evidence of association of this variant with smoking cessation and suggest that polymorphisms in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor beta2 subunit gene may influence therapeutic responsiveness to cessation medications.

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: To examine whether socioeconomic status, as measured by educational attainment and annual household income, is associated with lifetime risk for workplace eye injury in a large US population. METHODS: In analyses of data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (2005-2007, N = 43,510), we used logistic regression analysis and propensity score matching to assess associations between socioeconomic measures and lifetime risk for workplace eye injury among those aged >/=50 years. RESULTS: The lifetime prevalence of self-reported workplace eye injury was significantly higher among men (13.5%) than women (2.6%) (P < 0.001). After adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, eye care insurance, health status, and risk-taking behaviors, men with less than high school education (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 2.24, 95% CI: 1.74-2.87) or high school education (adjusted OR = 1.92, 95% CI: 1.57-2.33) were more likely to report having had a lifetime workplace eye injury than those with more than a high school education. Men with an annual household income <$15,000 were also more likely to report having had a lifetime workplace eye injury than those whose income was >$50,000 (adjusted OR = 1.44, 95% CI: 1.07-1.95). After adjusting for other factors, no statistically significant associations between education, income, and lifetime workplace eye injury were found among women. CONCLUSIONS: Socioeconomic status was associated with lifetime risk for workplace eye injury among men but not women. Greater public awareness of individual and societal impacts of workplace eye injuries, especially among socioeconomically disadvantaged men, could help support efforts to develop a coordinated prevention strategy to minimize avoidable workplace eye injuries.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Declining participation in epidemiological studies has been reported in recent decades and may lead to biased prevalence estimates and selection bias. The aim of the study was to identify possible causes and effects of non-response in a population-based study of respiratory health in Norway. DESIGN: The Telemark study is a longitudinal study that began with a cross-sectional survey in 2013. SETTING: In 2013, a random sample of 50 000 inhabitants aged 16-50 years, living in Telemark county, received a validated postal questionnaire. The response rate was 33%. In this study, a random sample of 700 non-responders was contacted first by telephone and then by mail. OUTCOME MEASURES: Response rates, prevalence and OR of asthma and respiratory symptoms based on exposure to vapours, gas, dust or fumes (VGDF) and smoking. Causes of non-response. RESULTS: A total of 260 non-responders (37%) participated. Non-response was associated with younger age, male sex, living in a rural area and past smoking. The prevalence was similar for responders and non-responders for physician-diagnosed asthma and several respiratory symptoms. The prevalence of chronic cough and use of asthma medication was overestimated in the Telemark study, and adjusted prevalence estimates were 17.4% and 5%, respectively. Current smoking was identified as a risk factor for respiratory symptoms among responders and non-responders, while occupational VGDF exposure was a risk factor only among responders. The Breslow-Day test detected heterogeneity between productive cough and occupational VGDF exposure among responders. CONCLUSIONS: The Telemark study provided valid estimates for physician-diagnosed asthma and several respiratory symptoms, while it was necessary to adjust prevalence estimates for chronic cough and use of asthma medication. Reminder letters had little effect on risk factor associations. Selection bias should be considered in future investigations of the relationship between respiratory outcomes and exposures.",

OBJECTIVES: Our study aimed to estimate the frequency of human bocavirus (HBoV) infection among pediatric populations in Argentina, Nicaragua and Peru. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study using stored samples of an influenza-like illness surveillance program. Irrespective of previous diagnosis, nasopharyngeal or nasal swab specimens were randomly selected and tested using real-time PCR from three sites during 2007 from patients younger than 6 years old. RESULTS: A total of 568 specimens from Argentina (185), Nicaragua (192) and Peru (191) were tested. The prevalence of HBoV was 10.8% (95% CI: 6.3; 15.3) in Argentina, 33.3% in Nicaragua (95% CI: 26.6; 40.1) and 25.1% in Peru (95% CI: 18.9; 31.3).

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The Health and Safety Practices Survey of Healthcare Workers describes current practices used to minimize chemical exposures and barriers to using recommended personal protective equipment for the following: antineoplastic drugs, anesthetic gases, high level disinfectants, surgical smoke, aerosolized medications (pentamidine, ribavirin, and antibiotics), and chemical sterilants. METHODS: Twenty-one healthcare professional practice organizations collaborated with NIOSH to develop and implement the web-based survey. RESULTS: Twelve thousand twenty-eight respondents included professional, technical, and support occupations which routinely come in contact with the targeted hazardous chemicals. Chemical-specific safe handling training was lowest for aerosolized antibiotics (52%, n = 316), and surgical smoke (57%, n = 4,747). Reported employer procedures for minimizing exposure was lowest for surgical smoke (32%, n = 4,746) and anesthetic gases (56%, n = 3,604). CONCLUSIONS: Training and having procedures in place to minimize exposure to these chemicals is one indication of employer and worker safety awareness. Safe handling practices for use of these chemicals will be reported in subsequent papers.",

        "abstract": "Youth carry the highest incidence of HIV infection in the United States. Understanding adolescent and young adult (AYA) perspectives on HIV transmission risk is important for targeted HIV prevention. We conducted a mixed methods study with HIV-infected and uninfected youth, ages 18-24 years, from Atlanta, GA. We provided self-administered surveys to HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected AYAs to identify risk factors for HIV acquisition. By means of computer-assisted thematic analyses, we examined transcribed focus group responses on HIV education, contributors to HIV transmission, and pre-sex HIV status disclosure. The 68 participants had the following characteristics: mean age 21.5 years (standard deviation: 1.8 years), 85% male, 90% black, 68% HIV-infected. HIV risk behaviors included the perception of condomless sex (Likert scale mean: 8.0) and transactional sex (88% of participants); no differences were noted by HIV status. Qualitative analyses revealed two main themes: (1) HIV risk factors among AYAs, and (2) barriers to discussing HIV status before sex. Participants felt the use of social media, need for immediate gratification, and lack of concern about HIV disease were risk factors for AYAs. Discussing HIV status with sex partners was uncommon. Key reasons included: fear of rejection, lack of confidentiality, discussion was unnecessary in temporary relationships, and disclosure negatively affecting the mood. HIV prevention strategies for AYAs should include improving condom use frequency and HIV disclosure skills, responsible utilization of social media, and education addressing HIV prevention including the risks of transactional sex.",

        "abstract": "The genetic polymorphisms of Echinococcus spp. in the eastern Tibetan Plateau and the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region were evaluated by DNA sequencing analyses of genes for mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) and nuclear elongation factor-1 alpha (ef1a). We collected 68 isolates of Echinococcus granulosus sensu stricto (s.s.) from Xinjiang and 113 isolates of E. granulosus s. s., 49 isolates of Echinococcus multilocularis and 34 isolates of Echinococcus shiquicus from the Tibetan Plateau. The results of molecular identification by mitochondrial and nuclear markers were identical, suggesting the infrequency of introgressive hybridization. A considerable intraspecific variation was detected in mitochondrial cox1 sequences. The parsimonious network of cox1 haplotypes showed star-like features in E. granulosus s. s. and E. multilocularis, but a divergent feature in E. shiquicus. The cox1 neutrality indexes computed by Tajima's D and Fu's Fs tests showed high negative values in E. granulosus s. s. and E. multilocularis, indicating significant deviations from neutrality. In contrast, the low positive values of both tests were obtained in E. shiquicus. These results suggest the following hypotheses: (i) recent founder effects arose in E. granulosus and E. multilocularis after introducing particular individuals into the endemic areas by anthropogenic movement or natural migration of host mammals, and (ii) the ancestor of E. shiquicus was segregated into the Tibetan Plateau by colonising alpine mammals and its mitochondrial locus has evolved without bottleneck effects.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To examine trends in the prevalence of hospitals and birth centers (hereafter, hospitals) distributing infant formula discharge packs to breastfeeding mothers in the United States from 2007 to 2013. METHODS: The Maternity Practices in Infant Nutrition and Care survey is administered every 2 years to all hospitals with registered maternity beds in the United States. A Web- or paper-based questionnaire was distributed and completed by the people most knowledgeable about breastfeeding-related hospital practices. We examined the distribution of infant formula discharge packs to breastfeeding mothers from 2007 to 2013 by state and hospital characteristics. RESULTS: The percentage of hospitals distributing infant formula discharge packs to breastfeeding mothers was 72.6% in 2007 and 31.6% in 2013, a decrease of 41 percentage points. In 2007, there was only 1 state (Rhode Island) in which <25% of hospitals distributed infant formula discharge packs to breastfeeding mothers, whereas in 2013 there were 24 such states and territories. Distribution declined across all hospital characteristics examined, including facility type, teaching versus nonteaching, and size (annual number of births). CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of infant formula discharge packs to breastfeeding mothers declined markedly from 2007 to 2013. Discontinuing the practice of distributing infant formula discharge packs is a part of optimal, evidence-based maternity care to support mothers who want to breastfeed.",

        "abstract": "Microorganisms may colonize needleless connectors (NCs) on intravascular catheters, forming biofilms and predisposing patients to catheter- associated infection (CAI). Standard and silver-coated NCs were collected from catheterized intensive care unit patients to characterize biofilm formation using culture-dependent and culture-independent methods and to investigate association between NC usage and biofilm characteristics. Viable microorganisms were detected by plate count (PC) from 46% of standard and 59% of silver-coated NCs (p=0.11). There were no significant associations (p>0.05, chi-squared test) between catheter type, side of catheter placement, number of catheter lumens, site of catheter placement, or NC duration, and positive NC. There was an association (p=0.04, chi-squared test) between infusion type and positive standard NCs. Viable microorganisms exhibiting intracellular esterase activity were detected on >90% of both NC types (p=0.751), suggesting that a large percentage of organisms were not culturable using the conditions provided in this study. Amplification of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene from selected NCs provided a substantially larger number of operational taxonomic units per NC than PC (26-43 vs 1-4), suggesting that culture-dependent methods may substantially underestimate microbial diversity on NCs. NC bacterial communities were clustered by patient and venous access type and may reflect the composition of the patient's local microbiome but may also contain organisms from the healthcare environment. NCs provide a portal of entry for a wide diversity of opportunistic pathogens to colonize the catheter lumen, forming a biofilm and increasing the potential for CAI, highlighting the importance of catheter maintenance practices to reduce microbial contamination.",

        "abstract": "Vaccine manufacturing costs prevent a significant portion of the world's population from accessing protection from vaccine-preventable diseases. To enhance vaccine production at reduced costs, a genome-wide RNAi screen was performed to identify gene knockdown events that enhanced poliovirus replication. Primary screen hits were validated in a Vero vaccine manufacturing cell line using attenuated and wild type poliovirus strains. Multiple single and dual gene silencing events increased poliovirus titers >20-fold and >50-fold, respectively. Host gene knockdown events did not affect virus antigenicity and CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout of the top candidates dramatically improved viral vaccine strain production. Interestingly, silencing of several genes that enhanced poliovirus replication also enhanced enterovirus 71, a clinically relevant virus for which vaccines are being targeted. The discovery that host gene modulation can markedly increase virus vaccine production dramatically alters mammalian cell-based vaccine manufacturing and should facilitate polio eradication using the inactivated poliovirus vaccine. IMPORTANCE: Using a genome-wide RNAi screen, a collection of host virus-resistance genes was identified that upon silencing increased poliovirus and enterovirus 71 production from 10-fold to >50-fold in a Vero vaccine manufacturing cell line. This study provides novel insights into enterovirus-host interactions, and describes an approach toward developing the next generation of vaccine manufacturing through engineered vaccine cell lines. The findings show that specific gene silencing and knockout events can enhance viral titers of both attenuated (Sabin) and wild polioviruses, a finding that should greatly facilitate global implementation of inactivated polio vaccine, as well as further reducing costs for live-attenuated oral polio vaccines. This work describes a platform-enabling technology applicable to most vaccine preventable diseases.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: To reduce disparities in breast and cervical cancer in the U.S., it is essential that programs such as CDC's National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program (NBCCEDP) use evidence-based strategies. Recommendations for interventions to increase breast and cervical cancer screening have been disseminated by national public health organizations. To increase screening, cancer control planners would benefit from use of evidence-based strategies for recruitment of participants in their communities. PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to inventory recruitment activities for cancer screening within NBCCEDP programs and assess if activities used to increase cancer screening are evidence-based. METHODS: Interviews were conducted with 61 recruitment coordinators in 2008 to elicit their recruitment activities, use of evidence-based resources, and barriers to using evidence-based interventions (EBIs). Study data were analyzed in 2009. RESULTS: Of the 340 activities reported, many were categorized as educational materials, one-on-one education, mass media, group education, and special events. Two thirds of inventoried activities matched an EBI. Coordinators reported that colleagues and the CDC are their primary sources of information about EBIs and few coordinators had used evidence-based resources. Lack of money or funding, questionable applicability to priority populations, limited staffing or staff time, and insufficient evidence-based research were the most important barriers to EBI use. CONCLUSIONS: Although the majority of NBCCEDP recruitment activities were evidence-based, one third were not. Additional training and technical assistance are recommended to help public health agencies adopt the use of these strategies.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Eliminating socioeconomic disparities in health is an overarching goal of the U.S. Healthy People decennial initiatives. We present recent trends in mortality by education among working-aged populations. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Age-standardized death rates and their average annual percent change for all-cause and five major causes (cancer, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and accidents) were calculated from 1993 through 2007 for individuals aged 25-64 years by educational attainment as a marker of socioeconomic status, using national vital registration data for 26 states with consistent educational information on the death certificates. Rate ratios and rate differences were used to assess disparities (</=12 versus >/=16 years of education) for 1993 through 2007. From 1993 through 2007, relative educational disparities in all-cause mortality continued to increase among working-aged men and women in the U.S., due to larger decreases of mortality rates among the most educated coupled with smaller decreases or even worsening trends in the less educated. For example, the rate ratios of all-cause mortality increased from 2.5 (95% confidence interval (CI), 2.4-2.6) in 1993 to 3.6 (95% CI, 3.5-3.7) in 2007 in men and from 1.9 (95% CI, 1.8-2.0) to 3.0 (95% CI, 2.9-3.1) in women. Generally, the rate differences (per 100,000 persons) of all-cause mortality increased from 415.5 (95% CI, 399.1-431.9) in 1993 to 472.7 (95% CI, 460.2-485.2) in 2007 in men and from 165.4 (95% CI, 154.5-176.2) to 256.2 (95% CI, 248.3-264.2) in women. Disparity patterns varied largely across the five specific causes considered in this study, with the largest increases of relative disparities for accidents, especially in women. CONCLUSIONS: Relative educational differentials in mortality continued to widen among men and women despite emphasis on reducing disparities in the U.S. Healthy People decennial initiatives.",

        "abstract": "Limited research shows an inconclusive association between soda intake and asthma, potentially attributable to certain preservatives in sodas. This cross-sectional study examined the association between regular (nondiet)-soda intake and current asthma among a nationally representative sample of high school students. Analysis was based on the 2009 national Youth Risk Behavior Survey and included 15,960 students (grades 9 through 12) with data for both regular-soda intake and current asthma status. The outcome measure was current asthma (ie, told by doctor/nurse that they had asthma and still have asthma). The main exposure variable was regular-soda intake (ie, drank a can/bottle/glass of soda during the 7 days before the survey). Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the adjusted odds ratios for regular-soda intake with current asthma after controlling for age, sex, race/ethnicity, weight status, and current cigarette use. Overall, 10.8% of students had current asthma. In addition, 9.7% of students who did not drink regular soda had current asthma, and 14.7% of students who drank regular soda three or more times per day had current asthma. Compared with those who did not drink regular soda, odds of having current asthma were higher among students who drank regular soda two times per day (adjusted odds ratio=1.28; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.62) and three or more times per day (adjusted odds ratio=1.64; 95% CI 1.25 to 2.16). The association between high regular-soda intake and current asthma suggests efforts to reduce regular-soda intake among youth might have benefits beyond improving diet quality. However, this association needs additional research, such as a longitudinal examination.",

In April 2010 the Kenyan government launched a program to immunize high-risk groups and healthcare workers (HCWs) with pH1N1 vaccines donated by the World Health Organization. To characterize HCWs' knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding pH1N1 vaccination, we conducted a quantitative and qualitative survey in 20 healthcare facilities across Kenya between January 11 and 26, 2010. Of 659 HCWs interviewed, 55% thought there was a vaccine against pH1N1, and 89% indicated that they would receive pH1N1 vaccine if it became available. In focus group discussions, many HCWs said that pH1N1 virus infection did not cause severe disease in Kenyans and questioned the need for vaccination. However, most were willing to accept vaccination if they had adequate information on safety and efficacy. In order for the influenza vaccination campaign to be successful, HCWs must understand that pH1N1 can cause severe disease in Kenyans, that pH1N1 vaccination can prevent HCWs from transmitting influenza to their patients, and that the vaccine has been widely used globally with few recognized adverse events.",

NVivo 8.0 was used for analysis. Most providers had no experience with pregnant women severely affected by influenza. Many perceived the 2009 H1N1 pandemic to be limited and mild. Providers knew that pregnant women should receive the 2009 H1N1 vaccine and reported plans to vaccinate more patients than the previous season. Most knew CDC guidelines for antiviral treatment and prophylaxis, but some reported hesitancy with presumptive treatment. Although awareness of influenza's potential to cause severe illness in pregnant women was observed, providers' experience and comfort with influenza prevention and treatment was suboptimal.

Because resources are limited, decision-makers need to understand the effect of different preventive interventions. We built a static model to estimate the potential number of cholera cases averted through improvements in coverage in water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) (i.e., latrines, point-of-use chlorination, and piped water), oral cholera vaccine (OCV), or a combination of both. We allowed indirect effects and non-linear relationships between effect and population coverage. Because there are limited incidence data for endemic cholera in Haiti, we estimated the incidence of cholera over 20 years in Haiti by using data from Malawi. Over the next two decades, scalable WASH interventions could avert 57,949-78,567 cholera cases, OCV could avert 38,569-77,636 cases, and interventions that combined WASH and OCV could avert 71,586-88,974 cases. Rate of implementation is the most influential variable, and combined approaches maximized the effect.",

        "abstract": "A magnetic proximity detection system mounted on an underground mobile mining machine detects whether a worker is hazardously close to the machine. The system generates magnetic fields covering the extended spaces around the machine. A magnetic detector worn by the worker measures the magnetic field flux density and determines the distance from it to the machine. The system is frequently in close proximity to coal as the machine moves, causing the magnetic field flux, in part, to enter massive in situ coal. This has the potential to have an adverse effect on the accuracy of the system and on the safety of the worker if the coal were to significantly alter the magnetic flux density distribution. Two experiments were conducted to study the impact of in situ coal on these magnetic fields. Measurements in one mine show that coal mass has no significant impact on the magnetic field flux distribution. 2013 This work was authored as part of the Contributors' official duties as Employees of the United States Government and is therefore a work of the United States Government.

        "abstract": "Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines prevent cervical pre-cancer lesion and can potentially reduce abnormal Papanicolaou (Pap) results among vaccinated females. However, current U.S. cervical screening guidelines recommend no change in screening initiation and frequency based on vaccination status. We examined providers' practices and beliefs about HPV vaccination to evaluate their adherence to guidelines. We used 4-year data (2007-2010) from two nationally representative samples totaling 2119 primary-care providers from the Cervical Cancer Screening Supplement to the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS). Providers in each survey were stratified to obstetrician/gynecologist (OB/GYNs) and non-OB/GYNs. Descriptive statistics and chi-square tests were performed to assess differences between providers' types in each survey. Approximately 60% of providers believed that HPV vaccination will result in fewer abnormal Pap tests and fewer referrals to colposcopy and over 92% would not change their cervical cancer screening practices for fully vaccinated females. NAMCS OB/GYNs were more likely (p<0.05) than non-OB/GYNs to rarely/never use the number of sexual partners to determine who gets the HPV vaccine (68.4% vs. 59.1%), more likely to recommend the vaccine to females with history of abnormal Pap (79.6% vs. 68.4%) and to females with a history of HPV positive test result (75.3% vs. 62.8%). Consistent with guidelines, most providers would not change cervical cancer screening practices based on patients' vaccination history. However, some providers used inappropriate tests for making vaccination decisions. Improving HPV vaccine knowledge and recommendations for its use is warranted to implement a successful vaccine program.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Diabetes is a risk factor for active tuberculosis (TB). Data are limited regarding the association between diabetes and TB drug resistance and treatment outcomes. We examined characteristics of TB patients with and without diabetes in a Peruvian cohort at high risk for drug-resistant TB. Among TB patients with diabetes (TB-DM), we studied the association between diabetes clinical/management characteristics and TB drug resistance and treatment outcomes. METHODS: During 2005-2008, adults with suspected TB with respiratory symptoms in Lima, Peru, who received rapid drug susceptibility testing (DST), were prospectively enrolled and followed during treatment. Bivariate and Kaplan-Meier analyses were used to examine the relationships of diabetes characteristics with drug-resistant TB and TB outcomes. RESULTS: Of 1671 adult TB patients enrolled, 186 (11.1%) had diabetes. TB-DM patients were significantly more likely than TB patients without diabetes to be older, have had no previous TB treatment, and to have a body mass index (BMI) >18.5kg/m(2) (p<0.05). In patients without and with previous TB treatment, the prevalence of multidrug-resistant TB was 23% and 26%, respectively, among patients without diabetes, and 12% and 28%, respectively, among TB-DM patients. Among 149 TB-DM patients with DST results, 104 (69.8%) had drug-susceptible TB and 45 (30.2%) had drug-resistant TB, of whom 29 had multidrug-resistant TB. There was no association between diabetes characteristics and drug-resistant TB. Of 136 TB-DM patients with outcome information, 107 (78.7%) had a favorable TB outcome; active diabetes management was associated with a favorable outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes was common in a cohort of TB patients at high risk for drug-resistant TB. Despite prevalent multidrug-resistant TB among TB-DM patients, the majority had a favorable TB treatment outcome.",

However, prevalence estimates are influenced by the methodology used, including measurement techniques, case definitions, and periodontal examination protocols, as well as differences in oral health status. As a consequence, comparisons between populations are severely hampered and inferences regarding the global variation in prevalence can hardly be drawn. To overcome these limitations, the authors suggest standardized principles for the reporting of the prevalence and severity of periodontal diseases in future epidemiological studies. These principles include the comprehensive reporting of the study design, the recording protocol, and specific subject-related and oral data. Further, a range of periodontal data should be reported in the total population and within specific age groups. Periodontal data include the prevalence and extent of clinical attachment loss (CAL) and probing depth (PD) on site and tooth level according to specific thresholds, mean CAL/PD, the CDC/AAP case definition, and bleeding on probing. Consistent implementation of these standards in future studies will ensure improved reporting quality, permit meaningful comparisons of the prevalence of periodontal diseases across populations, and provide better insights into the determinants of such variation.",

        "abstract": "CONTEXT: Recent years have seen rising interest in initiatives that focus on public health improvement. This includes support for accreditation of public health departments-administered by the Public Health Accreditation Board (PHAB)-and increasing expectations that health departments should use evidence-based programs, services, and policies (interventions) such as those described in The Guide to Community Preventive Services (The Community Guide). OBJECTIVE: This project was initiated to explore the potential connections between Community Guide interventions and PHAB domains, standards, and measures. DESIGN: The project team focused on developing a Crosswalk tool to assist health departments in identifying evidence-based interventions from The Community Guide whose implementation could help document conformity with PHAB domains, standards, and measures. All Community Preventive Services Task Force-recommended interventions were reviewed to determine whether they reflect the intent and requirements of the PHAB standards and measures. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Three types of connections were defined through which Community Guide interventions could be relevant to the required documentation for a PHAB measure. All instances of these connections were identified and included in the Crosswalk. RESULTS: The Crosswalk tool consists of 2 tables. The first table cross-references individual PHAB domains, standards, and measures with interventions from The Community Guide that could help provide documentation for accreditation. The second table can help accreditation preparation staff to engage with program staff. It is searchable by Community Guide topic, identifying the PHAB measures that relate to each Community Guide intervention within that topic. The type, location, and extent of connections between Community Guide interventions and PHAB domains, standards, and measures are presented and discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Tools such as the Crosswalk can be instrumental in advancing the use of evidence-based interventions in public health practice.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization recommends direct observation of treatment (DOT) to support patients with tuberculosis (TB) and to ensure treatment completion. As per national programme guidelines in India, a DOT provider can be anyone who is acceptable and accessible to the patient and accountable to the health system, except a family member. This poses challenges among children with TB who may be more comfortable receiving medicines from their parents or family members than from unfamiliar DOT providers. We conducted a non-inferiority trial to assess the effect of family DOT on treatment success rates among children with newly diagnosed TB registered for treatment during June-September 2012. METHODS: We randomly assigned all districts (n = 30) in Gujarat to the intervention (n = 15) or usual-practice group (n = 15). Adult family members in the intervention districts were given the choice to become their child's DOT provider. DOT was provided by a non-family member in the usual-practice districts. Using routinely collected clinic-based TB treatment cards, we compared treatment success rates (cured and treatment completed) between the two groups and the non-inferiority limit was kept at 5%. RESULTS: Of 624 children with newly diagnosed TB, 359 (58%) were from intervention districts and 265 (42%) were from usual-practice districts. The two groups were similar with respect to baseline characteristics including age, sex, type of TB, and initial body weight. The treatment success rates were 344 (95.8%) and 247 (93.2%) (p = 0.11) among the intervention and usual-practice groups respectively. CONCLUSION: DOT provided by a family member is not inferior to DOT provided by a non-family member among new TB cases in children and can attain international targets for treatment success.

        "abstract": "RATIONALE: There is uncertainty regarding how to interpret discordance between tests for latent tuberculosis infection. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to assess discordance between commercially available tests for latent tuberculosis in a low-prevalence population, including the impact of nontuberculous mycobacteria. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional comparison study among 2,017 military recruits at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, from April to June 2009. Several tests were performed simultaneously with a risk factor questionnaire, including (1) QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube test, (2) T-SPOT.TB test, (3) tuberculin skin test, and (4) Battey skin test using purified protein derivative from the Battey bacillus. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In this low-prevalence population, the specificities of the three commercially available diagnostic tests were not significantly different. Of the 88 subjects with a positive test, only 10 (11.4%) were positive to all three tests; 20 (22.7%) were positive to at least two tests. Bacille Calmette-Guerin vaccination, tuberculosis prevalence in country of birth, and Battey skin test reaction size were associated with tuberculin skin test-positive, IFN-gamma release assay-negative test discordance. Increasing agreement between the three tests was associated with epidemiologic criteria indicating risk of infection and with quantitative test results. CONCLUSIONS: For most positive results the three tests identified different people, suggesting that in low-prevalence populations most discordant results are caused by false-positives. False-positive tuberculin skin test reactions associated with reactivity to nontuberculous mycobacteria and bacille Calmette-Guerin vaccination may account for a proportion of test discordance observed.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: This report presents national estimates of hospital inpatient care in the United States during 2007 and selected trend data. Numbers and rates of discharges, diagnoses, and procedures are shown by age and sex. Average lengths of stay are presented for all discharges and for selected diagnostic categories by age and by sex. METHODS: The estimates are based on data collected through the 2007 National Hospital Discharge Survey, an annual national probability sample survey of discharges from nonfederal, general, and short-stay hospitals. Sample data are weighted to produce annual estimates of inpatient care, excluding newborns. Diagnoses and procedures are coded using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification. RESULTS: In 2007, there were an estimated 34.4 million hospital discharges, excluding newborns. The total hospitalization rate leveled off from 1995 to 2007 after declining during the period from 1980 to 1995. Throughout the period from 1970 to 2007 the rates for those aged 65 years and over were significantly higher than the rates for the younger groups. Although those aged 65 years and over accounted for only 13 percent of the total population, they comprised 37 percent of hospital discharges and 43 percent of hospital days. One-quarter of inpatients under age 15 years were hospitalized for respiratory diseases. There were 45 million inpatient procedures during 2007 and 15 percent of these were cardiovascular. Males aged 45-64 and 65 years and over had higher cardiac catheterization rates than females in these age groups each year from 1997 to 2007. From 2002 to 2007 the rate of inpatient cardiac catheterization procedures declined.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Evidence suggests that high-risk lifestyle behaviors exacerbate the health of cancer survivors and increase cancer mortality. This study examined the prevalence of lifestyle-related risk factors among female breast cancer survivors by duration of survivorship in the United States. METHODS: We analyzed data from 7,443 women aged >/=18 years who participated in the 2009 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and reported having ever-diagnosed breast cancer. Adjusted prevalence with 95 % confidence interval for lifestyle-related risk factors (including current smoking, excessive alcohol drinking, obesity, engaging in physical activity >/=150 min/week, and consuming fruits and vegetables >/=5 times/day) was estimated using log-linear regression while controlling for confounders. RESULTS: Overall, the prevalence estimates for lifestyle-related risk factors were 10.2 % for current smoking, 6.8 % for excessive alcohol drinking, 24.7 % for obesity, 53.8 % for engaging in physical activity >/=150 min/week, and 33.9 % for consuming fruits and vegetables >/=5 times/day among female breast cancer survivors. After adjustment for covariates, with increasing years of survivorship, a linearly increasing trend was observed for current smoking (P = 0.038), and quadratic trends were observed for excessive alcohol drinking (P < 0.001) and obesity (P = 0.048). The adjusted prevalence estimates for engaging in physical activity >/=150 min/week and consuming fruits and vegetables >/=5 times/day did not vary significantly by duration of survivorship. CONCLUSION: Continuing efforts on counseling and encouraging breast cancer survivors to adopt healthy lifestyles are needed to improve their health. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Understanding the trends of modifiable lifestyle-related risk factors among breast cancer survivors with varying duration of survivorship may assist health care providers to provide appropriate counseling for breast cancer patients to improve their health. Clinical and public health intervention programs should seek to maximize the number of recommended healthy behaviors especially in those women who are at high risk for failing to comply with the healthy lifestyle guidelines.",

        "abstract": "On July 8, 2011, the New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services (NJDHSS) contacted CDC about possible rabies in a hospitalized Haitian woman aged 73 years. Rabies was included in the differential diagnosis because she had acute, progressive encephalitis of unknown etiology. No history of animal exposure had been reported at the time of hospitalization. On July 18, CDC confirmed rabies virus infection, later identified as a canine rabies virus variant present in Haiti. The patient's neurologic status continued to deteriorate, leading to her death on July 20. This report summarizes the patient's clinical course and the associated public health investigation. This is the third report of human rabies in the United States acquired in Haiti since 2000 and highlights the importance of obtaining a detailed history for patients who have traveled from a rabies-endemic country and the value of consultation with medical and public health professionals regarding any animal bites.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Information is scarce about the combined effects on breast cancer incidence of low-penetrance genetic susceptibility polymorphisms and environmental factors (reproductive, behavioural, and anthropometric risk factors for breast cancer). To test for evidence of gene-environment interactions, we compared genotypic relative risks for breast cancer across the other risk factors in a large UK prospective study. METHODS:  We tested gene-environment interactions in 7610 women who developed breast cancer and 10 196 controls without the disease, studying the effects of 12 polymorphisms (FGFR2-rs2981582, TNRC9-rs3803662, 2q35-rs13387042, MAP3K1-rs889312, 8q24-rs13281615, 2p-rs4666451, 5p12-rs981782, CASP8-rs1045485, LSP1-rs3817198, 5q-rs30099, TGFB1-rs1982073, and ATM-rs1800054) in relation to prospectively collected information about ten established environmental risk factors (age at menarche, parity, age at first birth, breastfeeding, menopausal status, age at menopause, use of hormone replacement therapy, body-mass index, height, and alcohol consumption). FINDINGS:  After allowance for multiple testing none of the 120 comparisons yielded significant evidence of a gene-environment interaction. By contrast with previous suggestions, there was little evidence that the genotypic relative risks were affected by use of hormone replacement therapy, either overall or for oestrogen-receptor-positive disease. Only one of the 12 polymorphisms was correlated with any of the ten other risk factors: carriers of the high-risk C allele of MAP3K1-rs889312 were significantly shorter than non-carriers (mean height 162.4 cm [95% CI 162.1-162.7] vs 163.1 cm [162.9-163.2]; p=0.01 after allowance for multiple testing). INTERPRETATION: Risks of breast cancer associated with low-penetrance susceptibility polymorphisms do not vary significantly with these ten established environmental risk factors.

        "abstract": "CONTEXT: To target school-aged children (SAC), who were identified as a priority for pandemic 2009 Influenza A (pH1N1) vaccination, Maricopa County (MC) initiated school-based influenza vaccination in 69% of its 706 schools during the 2009-2010 influenza season. OBJECTIVE: To determine factors associated with receipt of pH1N1 monovalent and 2009-2010 seasonal influenza vaccination among SAC and evaluate the association of school-based vaccination with vaccination status of SAC. DESIGN: Random-digit dialing was used to survey 600 MC households with willing adult participants and children grades K-12. Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with pH1N1 and seasonal vaccine receipt. SETTING: Arizona. PARTICIPANTS: Household adults with children grades K-12. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Characteristics of children, parents, and households were obtained. RESULTS: Among 909 SAC, 402 (44%) received pH1N1 and 436 (48%) received seasonal vaccination. Factors associated with pH1N1 vaccination included vaccine availability at school (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 1.6; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.0-2.7), high-risk medical condition in child (AOR: 2.4; 95% CI: 1.4-4.0), elementary versus high school attendance (AOR: 1.6; 95% CI: 1.0-2.7), and seasonal influenza vaccination (AOR: 10.0; 95% CI: 6.4-15.6). Factors associated with seasonal vaccination included Hispanic ethnicity (AOR: 2.2; 95% CI: 1.1-4.2), health insurance coverage (AOR: 4.8; 95% CI: 1.7-13.7), elementary versus high school attendance (AOR: 1.5; 95% CI: 1.0-2.5), and pH1N1 vaccination (AOR: 10.5; 95% CI: 6.7-16.6). CONCLUSIONS: Availability of pH1N1 vaccine at school was independently associated with pH1N1 vaccination of MC school-aged children. School-based influenza vaccination campaigns should be considered to increase vaccination among this population.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To estimate HIV prevalence and characterize risk factors among young adults in Asembo, rural western Kenya. DESIGN: Community-based cross-sectional survey. METHODS: From a demographic surveillance system, we selected a random sample of residents aged 13-34 years, who were contacted at home and invited to a nearby mobile study site. Consent procedures for non-emancipated minors required assent and parental consent. From October 2003 - April 2004, consenting participants were interviewed on risk behavior and tested for HIV and HSV-2. HIV voluntary counseling and testing was offered. RESULTS: Of 2606 eligible residents, 1822 (70%) enrolled. Primary reasons for refusal included not wanting blood taken, not wanting to learn HIV status, and partner/parental objection. Females comprised 53% of 1762 participants providing blood. Adjusted HIV prevalence was 15.4% overall: 20.5% among females and 10.2% among males. HIV prevalence was highest in women aged 25-29 years (36.5%) and men aged 30-34 years (41.1%). HSV-2 prevalence was 40.0% overall: 53% among females, 25.8% among males. In multivariate models stratified by gender and marital status, HIV infection was strongly associated with age, higher number of sex partners, widowhood, and HSV-2 seropositivity. CONCLUSIONS: Asembo has extremely high HIV and HSV-2 prevalence, and probable high incidence, among young adults. Further research on circumstances around HIV acquisition in young women and novel prevention strategies (vaccines, microbicides, pre-exposure prophylaxis, HSV-2 prevention, etc.) are urgently needed.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although norovirus is the most common cause of gastroenteritis, there are few data on the community incidence of infection/disease or the patterns of acquired immunity or innate resistance to norovirus. METHODS: We followed a community-based birth cohort of 194 children in Ecuador with the aim to estimate (1) incidence of norovirus gastroenteritis from birth to three years (2) the protective effect of norovirus infection on subsequent infection/disease and (3) the association of infection/disease with secretor status. RESULTS: Over the 3-year period, we detected a mean of 2.26 (Range 0 - 12) diarrheal episodes per child. Norovirus was detected in 260 (18%) samples, but not more frequently in diarrhea samples (79/438; 18%) than diarrhea-free samples (181/1016; 18%, p=0.919). 66% of children had at least one norovirus infection during the first 3 years of life and 40% of children had two infections. Previous norovirus infections were not associated with subsequent risk of infection. All GII.4 infections were amongst secretor positive children (p<0.001), but higher rates of non-GII.4 infections were found in secretor-negative children (RR=0.56; p=0.029). CONCLUSIONS: GII.4 infections were uniquely detected in secretor positive children while non-GII.4 infections were more often found in secretor negatives.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pronounced changes in patterns of health take place in adolescence and young adulthood, but the effects on mortality patterns worldwide have not been reported. We analysed worldwide rates and patterns of mortality between early adolescence and young adulthood. METHODS: We obtained data from the 2004 Global Burden of Disease Study, and used all-cause mortality estimates developed for the 2006 World Health Report, with adjustments for revisions in death from HIV/AIDS and from war and natural disasters. Data for cause of death were derived from national vital registration when available; for other countries we used sample registration data, verbal autopsy, and disease surveillance data to model causes of death. Worldwide rates and patterns of mortality were investigated by WHO region, income status, and cause in age-groups of 10–14 years, 15–19 years, and 20–24 years. FINDINGS: 2.6 million deaths occurred in people aged 10–24 years in 2004. 2.56 million (97%) of these deaths were in low-income and middle-income countries, and almost two thirds (1·67 million) were in sub-Saharan Africa and southeast Asia. Pronounced rises in mortality rates were recorded from early adolescence (10–14 years) to young adulthood (20–24 years), but reasons varied by region and sex. Maternal conditions were a leading cause of female deaths at 15%. HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis contributed to 11% of deaths. Traffic accidents were the largest cause and accounted for 14% of male and 5% of female deaths. Other prominent causes included violence (12% of male deaths) and suicide (6% of all deaths). INTERPRETATION: Present global priorities for adolescent health policy, which focus on HIV/AIDS and maternal mortality, are an important but insufficient response to prevent mortality in an age-group in which more than two in five deaths are due to intentional and unintentional injuries.

        "abstract": "This study investigated the physiological responses to wearing a standard firefighter ensemble (SE) and a prototype ensemble (PE) modified from the SE that contained additional features, such as magnetic ring enclosures at the glove-sleeve interface, integrated boot-pant interface, integrated hood-SCBA facepiece interface, and a novel hose arrangement that rerouted self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) exhaust gases back into the upper portion of the jacket. Although the features of the PE increased the level of encapsulation of the wearer that could lead to increased physiological stress compared with the SE, it was hypothesized that the rerouted exhaust gases provided by the PE hose assembly would (1) provide convective cooling to the upper torso, (2) reduce the thermal stress experienced by the wearer, and (3) reduce the overall physiological stress imposed by the PE such that it would be either less or not significantly different from the SE. Ten subjects (seven male, three female) performed treadmill exercise in an environmental chamber (22 degrees C, 50% RH) at 50% [image omitted]O(2max) while wearing either the SE with an SCBA or the PE with an SCBA either with or without the hose attached (designated PEWH and PENH, respectively). Heart rate (HR), rectal and intestinal temperatures (T(re), T(in)), sweat loss, and endurance time were measured. All subjects completed at least 20 min of treadmill exercise during the testing. At the end of exercise, there was no difference in T(re) (p = 0.45) or T(in) (p = 0.42), HR, or total sweat loss between the SE and either PEWH or PENH (p = 0.59). However, T(sk) was greater in PEWH and PENH compared with SE (p < 0.05). Total endurance time in SE was greater than in either PEWH or PENH (p < 0.05). Thus, it was concluded that the rerouting of exhaust gases to the jacket did not provide significant convective cooling or reduce thermal stress compared with the SE under the mild conditions selected, and the data did not support the hypotheses of the present study.",

        "abstract": "Understanding how malaria parasites move between populations is important, particularly given the potential for malaria to be reintroduced into areas where it was previously eliminated. We examine the distribution of malaria genetics across seven sites within the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and two nearby countries, Ghana and Kenya, in order to understand how the relatedness of malaria parasites varies across space, and whether there are barriers to the flow of malaria parasites within the DRC or across borders. Parasite DNA was retrieved from dried blood spots from 7 Demographic and Health Survey sample clusters in the DRC. Malaria genetic characteristics of parasites from Ghana and Kenya were also obtained. For each of 9 geographic sites (7 DRC, 1 Ghana and 1 Kenya), a pair-wise RST statistic was calculated, indicating the genetic distance between malaria parasites found in those locations. Mapping genetics across the spatial extent of the study area indicates a complex genetic landscape, where relatedness between two proximal sites may be relatively high (RST > 0.64) or low (RST < 0.05), and where distal sites also exhibit both high and low genetic similarity. Mantel's tests suggest that malaria genetics differ as geographic distances increase. Principal Coordinate Analysis suggests that genetically related samples are not co-located. Barrier analysis reveals no significant barriers to gene flow between locations. Malaria genetics in the DRC have a complex and fragmented landscape. Limited exchange of genes across space is reflected in greater genetic distance between malaria parasites isolated at greater geographic distances. There is, however, evidence for close genetic ties between distally located sample locations, indicating that movement of malaria parasites and flow of genes is being driven by factors other than distance decay. This research demonstrates the contributions that spatial disease ecology and landscape genetics can make to understanding the evolutionary dynamics of infectious diseases.",

        "abstract": "Sand flies include a group of insects that are of medical importance and that vary in geographic distribution, ecology, and pathogen transmission. Approximately 163 species of sand flies have been reported in Colombia. Surveillance of the presence of sand fly species and the actualization of species distribution are important for predicting risks for and monitoring the expansion of diseases which sand flies can transmit. Currently, the identification of phlebotomine sand flies is based on morphological characters. However, morphological identification requires considerable skills and taxonomic expertise. In addition, significant morphological similarity between some species, especially among females, may cause difficulties during the identification process. DNA-based approaches have become increasingly useful and promising tools for estimating sand fly diversity and for ensuring the rapid and accurate identification of species. A partial sequence of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase gene subunit I (COI) is currently being used to differentiate species in different animal taxa, including insects, and it is referred as a barcoding sequence. The present study explored the utility of the DNA barcode approach for the identification of phlebotomine sand flies in Colombia. We sequenced 700 bp of the COI gene from 36 species collected from different geographic localities. The COI barcode sequence divergence within a single species was <2% in most cases, whereas this divergence ranged from 9% to 26.6% among different species. These results indicated that the barcoding gene correctly discriminated among the previously morphologically identified species with an efficacy of nearly 100%. Analyses of the generated sequences indicated that the observed species groupings were consistent with the morphological identifications. In conclusion, the barcoding gene was useful for species discrimination in sand flies from Colombia.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mass drug administration (MDA), defined as the empiric administration of a therapeutic antimalarial regimen to an entire population at the same time, has been a historic component of many malaria control and elimination programmes, but is not currently recommended. With renewed interest in MDA and its role in malaria elimination, this review aims to summarize the findings from existing research studies and program experiences of MDA strategies for reducing malaria burden and transmission. OBJECTIVES: To assess the impact of antimalarial MDA on population asexual parasitaemia prevalence, parasitaemia incidence, gametocytaemia prevalence, anaemia prevalence, mortality and MDA-associated adverse events. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Infectious Disease Group Specialized Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE+, EMBASE, to February 2013. We also searched CABS Abstracts, LILACS, reference lists, and recent conference proceedings. SELECTION CRITERIA: Cluster-randomized trials and non-randomized controlled studies comparing therapeutic MDA versus placebo or no MDA, and uncontrolled before-and-after studies comparing post-MDA to baseline data were selected. Studies administering intermittent preventive treatment (IPT) to sub-populations (for example, pregnant women, children or infants) were excluded. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently reviewed studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Studies were stratified by study design and then subgrouped by endemicity, by co-administration of 8-aminoquinoline plus schizonticide drugs and by plasmodium species. The quality of evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS: Two cluster-randomized trials, eight non-randomized controlled studies and 22 uncontrolled before-and-after studies are included in this review. Twenty-two studies (29 comparisons) compared MDA to placebo or no intervention of which two comparisons were conducted in areas of low endemicity (</=5%), 12 in areas of moderate endemicity (6-39%) and 15 in areas of high endemicity (>/= 40%). Ten studies evaluated MDA plus other vector control measures. The studies used a wide variety of MDA regimens incorporating different drugs, dosages, timings and numbers of MDA rounds. Many of the studies are now more than 30 years old. Areas of low endemicity (</=5%)Within the first month post-MDA, a single uncontrolled before-and-after study conducted in 1955 on a small Taiwanese island reported a much lower prevalence of parasitaemia following a single course of chloroquine compared to baseline (1 study, very low quality evidence). This lower parasite prevalence was still present after more than 12 months (one study, very low quality evidence). In addition, one cluster-randomized trial evaluating MDA in a low endemic setting reported zero episodes of parasitaemia at baseline, and throughout five months of follow-up in both the control and intervention arms (one study, very low quality evidence). Areas of moderate endemicity (6-39%)Within the first month post-MDA, the prevalence of parasitaemia was much lower in three non-randomized controlled studies from Kenya and India in the 1950s (RR 0.03, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.08, three studies, moderate quality evidence), and in three uncontrolled before-and-after studies conducted between 1954 and 1961 (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.48, three studies,low quality evidence).The longest follow-up in these settings was four to six months. At this time point, the prevalence of parasitaemia remained substantially lower than controls in the two non-randomized controlled studies (RR 0.18, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.33, two studies, low quality evidence). In contrast, the two uncontrolled before-and-after studies found mixed results: one found no difference and one found a substantially higher prevalence compared to baseline (not pooled, two studies, very low quality evidence). Areas of high endemicity (>/=40%)Within the first month post-MDA, the single cluster-randomized trial from the Gambia in 1999 found no significant difference in parasite prevalence (one study, low quality evidence). However, prevalence was much lower during the MDA programmes in three non-randomized controlled studies conducted in the 1960s and 1970s (RR 0.17, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.27, three studies, moderate quality evidence), and within one month of MDA in four uncontrolled before-and-after studies (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.49, four studies,low quality evidence).Four trials reported changes in prevalence beyond three months. In the Gambia, the single cluster-randomized trial found no difference at five months (one trial, moderate quality evidence). The three uncontrolled before-and-after studies had mixed findings with large studies from Palestine and Cambodia showing sustained reductions at four months and 12 months, respectively, and a small study from Malaysia showing no difference after four to six months of follow-up (three studies,low quality evidence). 8-aminoquinolinesWe found no studies directly comparing MDA regimens that included 8-aminoquinolines with regimens that did not. In a crude subgroup analysis with a limited number of studies, we were unable to detect any evidence of additional benefit of primaquine in moderate- and high-transmission settings. Plasmodium speciesIn studies that reported species-specific outcomes, the same interventions resulted in a larger impact on Plasmodium falciparum compared to P. vivax. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: MDA appears to reduce substantially the initial risk of malaria parasitaemia. However, few studies showed sustained impact beyond six months post-MDA, and those that did were conducted on small islands or in highland settings.To assess whether there is an impact of MDA on malaria transmission in the longer term requires more quasi experimental studies with the intention of elimination, especially in low- and moderate-transmission settings. These studies need to address any long-term outcomes, any potential barriers for community uptake, and contribution to the development of drug resistance.",

        "abstract": "The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that infants be breastfed exclusively* for the first 6 months of life, and that mothers continue breastfeeding for at least 1 year (1). However, in 2011, only 19.3% of mothers aged </=20 years in the United States exclusively breastfed their infants at 3 months, compared with 36.4% of women aged 20-29 years and 45.0% of women aged >/=30 years.(dagger) Hospitals play an essential role in providing care that helps mothers establish and continue breastfeeding. The U.S. Surgeon General and numerous health professional organizations recommend providing care aligned with the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI), including adherence to the Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding (Ten Steps), as well as not providing gift packs containing infant formula (2,3). Implementing BFHI-aligned maternity care improves duration of any and exclusive breastfeeding among mothers (4,5); however, studies have not examined associations between BFHI-aligned maternity care and breastfeeding outcomes solely among adolescent mothers (for this report, adolescents refers to persons aged 12-19 years). Therefore, CDC analyzed 2009-2011 Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) data and determined that among adolescent mothers who initiated breastfeeding, self-reported prevalence of experiencing any of the nine selected BFHI-aligned maternity care practices included in the PRAMS survey ranged from 29.2% to 95.4%. Among the five practices identified to be significantly associated with breastfeeding outcomes in this study, the more practices a mother experienced, the more likely she was to be breastfeeding (any amount or exclusively) at 4 weeks and 8 weeks postpartum. Given the substantial health advantages conferred to mothers and children through breastfeeding, and the particular vulnerability of adolescent mothers to lower breastfeeding rates, it is important for hospitals to provide evidence-based maternity practices related to breastfeeding as part of their routine care to all mothers, including adolescent mothers.",

        "abstract": "Accurate diagnosis of influenza is critical for clinical management, infection control, and public health actions to minimize the burden of disease. Commercially available rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs) that detect the influenza virus nucleoprotein (NP) antigen are widely used in clinical practice for diagnosing influenza because they are simple to use and provide results within 15 minutes; however, there has not been a recent comprehensive analytical evaluation of available RIDTs using a standard method with a panel of representative seasonal influenza viruses. This report describes an evaluation of 11 Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared RIDTs using 23 recently circulating influenza viruses under identical conditions in a laboratory setting to assess analytical performance. Most RIDTs detected viral antigens in samples with the highest influenza virus concentrations, but detection varied by virus type and subtype at lower concentrations. Clinicians should be aware of the variability of RIDTs when interpreting negative results and should collect test samples using methods that can maximize the concentration of virus antigen in the sample, such as collecting adequate specimens using appropriate methods in the first 24-72 hours after illness onset. The study design described in this report can be used to evaluate the performance of RIDTs available in the United States now and in the future.",

Among seropositive participants (vibriocidal titers >/= 320), 74.5% reported no diarrhea and 9.0% had severe cholera (reported receiving intravenous fluids and overnight hospitalization). This high burden of severe cholera is likely explained by the lack of pre-existing immunity in this population, although the virulence of the atypical El Tor strain causing the epidemic and other factors might also play a role.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Low heart rate variability (HRV) has been linked to cardiovascular disease. Our objective was to examine the cross-sectional association between insulin and HRV. METHODS: Insulin levels were measured in 355 nondiabetic officers from the BCOPS study, following a 12 h fast. HRV was performed according to methods published by the task force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing Electrophysiology for measurement and analysis of HRV. Mean values of high (HF) and low frequency (LF) HRV were compared across tertiles of insulin using ANOVA and ANCOVA; p-values were obtained from linear regression models. RESULTS: Higher mean levels of insulin were significantly associated with lower (i.e., worse) mean levels of HRV before and after risk-factor adjustment. The results for HF HRV (ms2 ) were as follows: 1st insulin (microU/ml) tertile (156.3; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 128.6-189.9); 2nd tertile (154.3; 95% CI = 124.3-191.5); 3rd tertile (127.9; 95% CI = 105.0-155.8), p for trend = 0.017. Results with LF HRV were similar to HF HRV. Insulin was also inversely and significantly associated with HRV among officers with BMI >/=25 kg/m2 , with >/=25.5% body fat, and among those who reported low (<median) physical activity scores. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort, insulin levels were inversely and significantly associated with both HF and LF HRV, especially among those with higher levels of obesity and lower levels of physical activity, suggesting associations with autonomic nervous system function. Prospective studies of this association in other populations are warranted. Am. J. Hum. Biol., 2013. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Research on the deposition of mainstream smoke particulate in the respiratory tract of smokers is needed to understand how exposure may vary based on cigarette menthol content. METHODS: We conducted a nine-participant crossover study in which smokers were randomly assigned to cigarettes differing primarily in menthol content. Participants smoked the test cigarettes ad libitum for one week, provided spot urine samples, and then smoked four test cigarettes in a laboratory session; this was repeated for the other test cigarette in week two. Fine and ultrafine particulate matter in exhaled breath were characterized, and smoking behavior was monitored. Participant-specific mainstream smoke, generated using each participant's topography data, was characterized. During home smoking, participants collected their spent test cigarette butts for estimates of mouth-level exposures (MLE) to mainstream nicotine and 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK). RESULTS: Participant-specific mainstream smoke NNK was higher (39%) and daily MLE to NNK was also higher (52%) when participants smoked the menthol cigarette. Nicotine was not significantly different. Participants retained more ultrafine particulate (43%) and fine particulate benzo(a)pyrene (43%) when smoking the menthol cigarette. There were no significant differences in the levels of urinary biomarkers for nicotine, NNK, or pyrene. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the use of noninvasive real-time techniques to measure exposure differences between cigarettes differing primarily in menthol content. Differences between NNK exposure, ultrafine particle and benzo(a)pyrene deposition, and smoking behavior were observed. Additional research using these techniques with cigarettes that differ only in menthol content is required to unequivocally attribute the exposure differences to presence or absence of menthol.",

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to test whether introduction of solid foods influences energy intake or growth. DESIGN: Healthy, formula-fed infants who were recruited in 5 European countries were eligible for study participation. Anthropometric measurements were taken at recruitment and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 mo. Time of introduction of solid foods and energy intake were determined by questionnaires and 3-d weighed food records at monthly intervals. Age at introduction of solid food was categorized into 4 groups: </=13 wk, 14-17 wk, 18-21 wk, and >/=22 wk. RESULTS: Of 1090 recruited infants, 830 (76%) had data available for age at first introduction of solid food, and 671 (61%) completed the study until 24 mo of age. The median age at introduction of solid food was 19 wk. The time of introduction of solid foods was associated with country, sex, birth weight, parental education and marital status, and maternal smoking. Energy intake was higher in the first 8 mo of life in children with solid-food intake. Solid-food introduction did not predict anthropometric measures at 24 mo. Growth trajectories differed significantly: children with solid-food introduction in the first 12 wk experienced early catch-up growth, whereas those introduced to solid food at >22 wk of age grew more slowly and stayed on lower trajectories. CONCLUSIONS: Solid foods do not simply replace infant formula but increase energy intake. Time of introduction of solid food has little influence on infant growth. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00338689.",

        "abstract": "Parapoxviruses are a genus of the double-stranded DNA family of poxviruses that infect ruminants, and zoonotic transmission to humans often results from occupational exposures. Parapoxvirus infection in humans begins with an incubation period of 3 to 7 days, followed by the development of one or more erythematous maculopapular lesions that evolve over the course of several weeks into nodules. In 2009, parapoxvirus infection was diagnosed in two deer hunters in the eastern United States after the hunters had field-dressed white-tailed deer. We describe the clinical and pathological features of these infections and the phylogenetic relationship of a unique strain of parapoxvirus to other parapoxviruses. Deer populations continue to increase, leading to the possibility that there will be more deer-associated parapoxvirus infections.",

        "abstract": "Influenza type B viruses are responsible for substantial morbidity and mortality in humans. Antiviral drugs are an important supplement to vaccination for reducing the public health impact of influenza virus infections. Influenza B viruses are not sensitive to M2 inhibitors which limit the current therapeutic options to two neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs), oseltamivir and zanamivir, which are licensed in many countries. Drug resistance is a public health concern which has necessitated monitoring of influenza virus drug susceptibilities through active global surveillance. Here, we report the results of drug susceptibility surveillance of influenza type B viruses (n=680) collected in mainland China during two calendar years, 2010 and 2011, assessed using functional neuraminidase (NA) inhibition (NI) assays. Four influenza B viruses exhibited reduced susceptibilities to oseltamivir, but not zanamivir, and shared the amino acid substitution I221T (ATC-->ACC), at this conserved residue in the NA active site (I222T in N2 numbering). Additionally, a single virus with reduced susceptibility to both oseltamivir and zanamivir was identified and contained an amino acid substitution D197N (GAC-->AAC) at another conserved residue in the NA active site (D198N in N2 numbering). This report underlies the importance of continued influenza antiviral susceptibility surveillance globally, even in countries where the use of NAIs has been low or non-existing.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Public health control of bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STIs) is dependent on the delivery of effective therapy and so will be compromised by the emergence of resistance. The scope of the problem and the implications for treatment that follow are discussed in this review. RECENT FINDINGS: Emerging resistance has been documented in all the bacterial STIs, but is considered rare and unconfirmed in Chlamydia trachomatis whereas is of global concern in Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Azithromycin resistance has now been recognized in Mycoplasma genitalium, Treponema pallidum and N. gonorrhoeae, questioning its widespread use for chlamydial infection and threatening its future use. Rapidly increasing levels of decreased susceptibility to the extended-spectrum cephalosporins in N. gonorrhoeae and emerging treatment failures to both cefixime and ceftriaxone, without an obvious alternative agent, are of considerable concern. Implications for treatment include choice and timing of any change in therapy, reintroduction of test of cure and definition of treatment failure in an era of molecular testing. SUMMARY: Emerging resistance in all bacterial STIs and the particular problem of resistant gonorrhoea will present a challenge to maintain antimicrobial therapy at the forefront of public health control.",

        "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Growing evidence of cell-to-cell transmission of neurodegenerative disease (ND)-associated proteins (NDAPs) (ie, tau, Abeta, and alpha-synuclein) suggests possible similarities to the infectious prion protein (PrPsc) in spongiform encephalopathies. There are limited data on the potential human-to-human transmission of NDAPs associated with Alzheimer disease (AD) and other non-PrPsc ND. OBJECTIVE: To examine evidence for human-to-human transmission of AD, Parkinson disease (PD), and related NDAPs in cadaveric human growth hormone (c-hGH) recipients. DESIGN: We conducted a detailed immunohistochemical analysis of pathological NDAPs other than PrPsc in human pituitary glands. We also searched for ND in recipients of pituitary-derived c-hGH by reviewing the National Hormone and Pituitary Program (NHPP) cohort database and medical literature. SETTING: University-based academic center and agencies of the US Department of Health and Human Services. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-four routine autopsy subjects (10 non-ND controls and 24 patients with ND) and a US cohort of c-hGH recipients in the NHPP. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Detectable NDAPs in human pituitary sections and death certificate reports of non-PrPsc ND in the NHPP database. RESULTS: We found mild amounts of pathological tau, Abeta, and alpha-synuclein deposits in the adeno/neurohypophysis of patients with ND and control patients. No cases of AD or PD were identified, and 3 deaths attributed to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) were found among US NHPP c-hGH recipients, including 2 of the 796 decedents in the originally confirmed NHPP c-hGH cohort database. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Despite the likely frequent exposure of c-hGH recipients to NDAPs, and their markedly elevated risk of PrPsc-related disease, this population of NHPP c-hGH recipients does not appear to be at increased risk of AD or PD. We discovered 3 ALS cases of unclear significance among US c-hGH recipients despite the absence of pathological deposits of ALS-associated proteins (TDP-43, FUS, and ubiquilin) in human pituitary glands. In this unique in vivo model of human-to-human transmission, we found no evidence to support concerns that NDAPs underlying AD and PD transmit disease in humans despite evidence of their cell-to-cell transmission in model systems of these disorders. Further monitoring is required to confirm these conclusions.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alcohol misuse, which includes the full spectrum from risky drinking to alcohol dependence, is a leading cause of preventable death in the United States. PURPOSE: To evaluate the benefits and harms of behavioral counseling interventions for adolescents and adults who misuse alcohol. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, CINAHL, PsycINFO, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, and reference lists of published literature (January 1985 through January 2012, limited to English-language articles). STUDY SELECTION: Controlled trials at least 6 months' duration that enrolled persons with alcohol misuse identified by screening in primary care settings and evaluated behavioral counseling interventions. DATA EXTRACTION: One reviewer extracted data and a second checked accuracy. Two independent reviewers assigned quality ratings and graded the strength of the evidence. DATA SYNTHESIS: The 23 included trials generally excluded persons with alcohol dependence. The best evidence was for brief (10- to 15-minute) multicontact interventions. Among adults receiving behavioral interventions, consumption decreased by 3.6 drinks per week from baseline (weighted mean difference, 3.6 drinks/wk [95% CI, 2.4 to 4.8 drinks/wk]; 10 trials; 4332 participants), 12% fewer adults reported heavy drinking episodes (risk difference, 0.12 [CI, 0.07 to 0.16]; 7 trials; 2737 participants), and 11% more adults reported drinking less than the recommended limits (risk difference, 0.11 [CI, 0.08 to 0.13]; 9 trials; 5973 participants) over 12 months compared with control participants (moderate strength of evidence). Evidence was insufficient to draw conclusions about accidents, injuries, or alcohol-related liver problems. Trials enrolling young adults or college students showed reduced consumption and fewer heavy drinking episodes (moderate strength of evidence). Little or no evidence of harms was found. LIMITATIONS: Results may be biased to the null because the behavior of control participants could have been affected by alcohol misuse assessments. In addition, evidence is probably inapplicable to persons with alcohol dependence and selective reporting may have occurred. CONCLUSION: Behavioral counseling interventions improve behavioral outcomes for adults with risky drinking.",

        "abstract": "7,8-Dihydroxyflavone is a recently identified small molecular tropomyosin-receptor-kinase B (TrkB) agonist. Our preliminary structural-activity relationship (SAR) study showed that the 7,8-dihydroxy groups are essential for the agonistic effect. To improve the lead compound's agonistic activity, we have conducted an extensive SAR study and synthesized numerous derivatives. We have successfully identified 4'-dimethylamino-7,8-dihydroxyflavone that displays higher TrkB agonistic activity than that of the lead. This novel compound also exhibits a more robust and longer TrkB activation effect in animals. Consequently, this new compound reveals more potent antiapoptotic activity. Interestingly, chronic oral administration of 4'-dimethylamino-7,8-dihydroxyflavone and its lead strongly promotes neurogenesis in dentate gyrus and demonstrates marked antidepressant effects. Hence, our data support that the synthetic 4'-dimethylamino-7,8-dihydroxyflavone and its lead both are orally bioavailable TrkB agonists and possess potent antidepressant effects.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To document the cost of implementing point-of-care (POC) human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) rapid testing in busy community pharmacies and retail clinics. Providing HIV testing services in community pharmacies and retail clinics is an innovative way to expand HIV testing. The cost of implementing POC HIV rapid testing in a busy retail environment needs to be documented to provide program and policy leaders with adequate information for planning and budgeting. DESIGN: Cost analysis from a pilot project that provided confidential POC HIV rapid testing services in community pharmacies and retail clinics. SETTING: The pharmacy sites were operated under several different ownership structures (for-profit, nonprofit, sole proprietorship, corporation, public, and private) in urban and rural areas. We included data from the initial six sites that participated in the project. We collected the time spent by pharmacy and retail clinic staff for pretest and posttest counseling in an activity log for time-in-motion for each interaction. PARTICIPANTS: Pharmacists and retail clinic staff. INTERVENTION: HIV rapid testing. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The total cost was calculated to include costs of test kits, control kits, shipping, test supplies, training, reporting, program administration, and advertising. RESULTS: The six sites trained 22 staff to implement HIV testing. A total of 939 HIV rapid tests were conducted over a median time of 12 months, of which 17 were reactive. Median pretest counseling time was 2 minutes. Median posttest counseling time was 2 minutes for clients with a nonreactive test and 10 minutes for clients with a reactive test. The average cost per person tested was an estimated $47.21. When we considered only recurrent costs, the average cost per person tested was $32.17. CONCLUSIONS: Providing POC HIV rapid testing services required a modest amount of staff time and costs that are comparable to other services offered in these settings. HIV testing in pharmacies and retail clinics can provide an additional alternative venue for increasing the availability and accessibility of HIV testing services in the United States.",

        "abstract": "On February 10, 2014, the USS Ardent, a U.S. Navy minesweeper, was moored in San Diego, California, while conducting training. Over the course of 3 days, 25 of 102 crew members sought medical care because of influenza-like illness (ILI). Nasal swab specimens were collected from each patient, and initial rapid influenza testing indicated 16 cases of influenza A. Ultimately, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing conducted by the Naval Health Research Center determined that 20 specimens were influenza A, of which 18 were subtype H3N2. Two specimens could not be subtyped. The HA gene sequence of an outbreak isolate was 99% identical to strains circulating during the 2013-14 influenza season and antigenically similar to the H3N2 component of the 2013-14 influenza vaccine. At the time of the outbreak, 99% of the crew had received influenza vaccine. Through the duration of the outbreak, the minesweeper squadron medical officer collaborated with Navy Environmental and Preventive Medicine Unit Five, higher-level Navy authorities, and County of San Diego Public Health Services to implement the outbreak response, which included disseminating outbreak information to surrounding Navy units, disinfecting the ship, sending home infected crew members, identifying family members at high risk, and providing antiviral medications and guidance. No crew member had onset of symptoms >6 days after the first crew member became ill. This outbreak highlights the risk for an H3N2 influenza outbreak among vaccinated and otherwise healthy young persons.",

        "abstract": "Despite differences in approaches to organizational problem solving, healthcare managers and organizational behavior management (OBM) practitioners share a number of practices, and connecting healthcare management with OBM may lead to improvements in patient safety. A broad needs-assessment methodology was applied to identify patient-safety intervention targets in a large rural medical center. This included a content analysis of descriptions of managers' follow-up actions to error reports for nine types of the most frequently occurring errors. Follow-up actions were coded according to the taxonomy of behavioral intervention components developed by Geller et al. (1990). Two error types were identified as targets for intervention, and the outcome of this assessment process indicated a clear need to apply OBM interventions at the management level and thus have a hospital-wide benefit to patient safety. Future implications for using a system-wide approach to identifying and classifying responses to medical error are discussed.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Little is known about the association between psychosocial factors and injury absence in the workplace. PURPOSE: This study aims to assess the association of comprehensive workplace psychosocial factors with work-related injury absence among Korean workers. METHODS: The data (n = 7,856) were derived from the First Korean Working Conditions Survey conducted in 2006 with a representative sample (n = 10,043) of the Korean working population. The survey instrument contained questions about hours of work, physical risk factors, work organization, and the effect of work on health/injury. Work-related injury absence was indicated by a dichotomous variable with at least 1 day absence during the preceding 12 months. Logistic regression models were used to calculate odds ratio and confidence interval (CI). Incremental adjustments for sociodemographic, health behavior, and occupational confounding variables were employed in the models. RESULTS: The overall 1-year prevalence of work-related injury absence in this study was 1.37 % (95 % CI, 1.11-1.63 %). Those who experienced violence at work (adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 7.05 (95 % CI, 2.69-18.5)), threat of violence at work (aOR, 4.25 (95 % CI, 1.32-13.64)), low job autonomy (aOR, 1.79 (95 % CI, 1.17-2.74)), and high job strain (aOR, 2.38 (95 % CI, 1.29-4.42) had an increased risk of injury absence, compared with their respective counterparts (p < 0.05). Among all job types, skilled workers in Korea were at a near fourfold risk of work absence due to occupational injuries, compared with managers in low-risk jobs. CONCLUSION: Workplace violence and increased job strain were two key workplace psychosocial factors associated with work-related injury absence.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The conjugate vaccine against serogroup A Neisseria meningitidis (NmA), MenAfriVac, was first introduced in mass vaccination campaigns of 1-29-year-olds in Burkina Faso in 2010. It is not known whether MenAfriVac has an impact on NmA carriage. METHODS: We conducted a repeated cross-sectional meningococcal carriage study in a representative portion of the 1-29-year-old population in 3 districts in Burkina Faso before and up to 13 months after vaccination. One district was vaccinated in September 2010, and the other 2 were vaccinated in December 2010. We analyzed 25,521 oropharyngeal samples, of which 22,093 were obtained after vaccination. RESULTS: In October-November 2010, NmA carriage prevalence in the unvaccinated districts was comparable to the baseline established in 2009, but absent in the vaccinated district. Serogroup X N. meningitidis (NmX) dominated in both vaccinated and unvaccinated districts. With 4 additional sampling campaigns performed throughout 2011 in the 3 districts, overall postvaccination meningococcal carriage prevalence was 6.95%, with NmX dominating but declining for each campaign (from 8.66% to 1.97%). Compared with a baseline NmA carriage prevalence of 0.39%, no NmA was identified after vaccination. Overall vaccination coverage in the population sampled was 89.7%, declining over time in 1-year-olds (from 87.1% to 26.5%), as unvaccinated infants reached 1 year of age. NmA carriage was eliminated in both the vaccinated and unvaccinated population from 3 weeks up to 13 months after mass vaccination (P = .003). CONCLUSIONS: The disappearance of NmA carriage among both vaccinated and unvaccinated populations is consistent with a vaccine-induced herd immunity effect.",

Quantitative analysis of CL and PS oxidation products is central to understanding their molecular mechanisms of action. We combined the identification of diverse phospholipid molecular species by ESI-MS with quantitative assessments of lipid hydroperoxides using a fluorescence HPLC-based protocol. We characterized CL and PS oxidation products formed in a model system (cyt c/H(2)O(2)), in apoptotic cells (neurons, pulmonary artery endothelial cells) and mouse lung under inflammatory/oxidative stress conditions (hyperoxia, inhalation of single walled carbon nanotubes). Our results demonstrate the usefulness of this approach for quantitative assessments, identification of individual molecular species and structural characterization of anionic phospholipids that are involved in oxidative modification in cells and tissues.",

Escherichia coli O157 is the most common STEC, although the number of reported non-O157 STEC infections is growing with the increased availability and use of enzyme immunoassay testing, which detects the presence of Shiga toxin in stool specimens. Prompt and accurate diagnosis of STEC infection facilitates appropriate therapy and may improve patient outcomes. METHODS: We mailed 2400 surveys to physicians in 8 Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet) sites to assess their knowledge and practices regarding STEC testing, treatment, and reporting, and their interpretation of Shiga toxin test results. RESULTS: Of 1102 completed surveys, 955 were included in this analysis. Most (83%) physicians reported often or always ordering a culture of bloody stool specimens; 49% believed that their laboratory routinely tested for STEC O157, and 30% believed that testing for non-O157 STEC was also included in a routine stool culture. Forty-two percent of physicians were aware that STEC, other than O157, can cause HUS, and 34% correctly interpreted a positive Shiga toxin test result. All STEC knowledge-related factors were strongly associated with correct interpretation of a positive Shiga toxin test result. CONCLUSIONS: Identification and management of STEC infection depends on laboratories testing for STEC and physicians ordering and correctly interpreting results of Shiga toxin tests. Although overall knowledge of STEC was low, physicians who had more knowledge were more likely to correctly interpret a Shiga toxin test result. Physician knowledge of STEC may be modifiable through educational interventions.",

        "abstract": "Among 1,683 persons in the United States who developed malaria following international travel during 2012, more than half acquired disease in one of 16 countries* in West Africa (1). Since March 2014, West Africa has experienced the world's largest epidemic of Ebola virus disease (Ebola), primarily affecting Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia; in 2014, approximately 20,000 Ebola cases were reported (2). Both Ebola and malaria are often characterized by fever and malaise and can be clinically indistinguishable, especially early in the course of disease. Immediate laboratory testing is critical for diagnosis of both Ebola and malaria, so that appropriate lifesaving treatment can be initiated. CDC recommends prompt malaria testing of patients with fever and history of travel to an area that is endemic for malaria, using blood smear microscopy, with results available within a few hours (3). Empiric treatment of malaria is not recommended by CDC (4). Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing is recommended to diagnose Ebola (5). During the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, CDC received reports of delayed laboratory testing for malaria in travelers returning to the United States because of infection control concerns related to Ebola (6). CDC reviewed documented calls to its malaria consultation service and selected three patient cases to present as examples of deficiencies in the evaluation and treatment of malaria among travelers returning from Africa during the Ebola epidemic.",

Research examining factors related to family engagement (i.e., enrollment and completion rates) may help program developers increase the impact of child abuse prevention services by reducing attrition. The present study examined the relative influence of provider,program, and individual factors from the Integrated Theory of Parent Involvement (ITPI) as well as maternal and family demo-graphic and risk variables in predicting service enrollment and completion in a home-based child maltreatment prevention service (SafeCarethorn) and a standard community care program (Services as Usual [SAU]). Participants were 398 female caregivers of children ages 5 and below. Support was found for the primary role of program and provider factors in client enrollment andcompletion of services. Specifically, participants in SafeCarethorn were 4 times more likely to enroll in services and 8.5 times morelikely to complete services than those in SAU. Family risk variables including intimate partner psychological aggression, substanceabuse, and depression were also significant predictors. Recommended next steps include integration of risk-related factors in the ITPI framework and disentangling specific provider and program factors related to service engagement.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In March of 2011, an earthquake struck Japan causing a tsunami that resulted in a radiological release from the damaged Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. Surveillance for potential radiological and any iodine/iodide product exposures was initiated on the National Poison Data System (NPDS) to target public health messaging needs within the United States (US). Our objectives are to describe self-reported exposures to radiation, potassium iodide (KI) and other iodine/iodide products which occurred during the US federal response and discuss its public health impact. METHODS: All calls to poison centers associated with the Japan incident were identified from March 11, 2011 to April 18, 2011 in NPDS. Exposure, demographic and health outcome information were collected. Calls about reported radiation exposures and KI or other iodine/iodide product ingestions were then categorized with regard to exposure likelihood based on follow-up information obtained from the PC where each call originated. Reported exposures were subsequently classified as probable exposures (high likelihood of exposure), probable non-exposures (low likelihood of exposure), and suspect exposure (unknown likelihood of exposure). RESULTS: We identified 400 calls to PCs associated with the incident, with 340 information requests (no exposure reported) and 60 reported exposures. The majority (n = 194; 57%) of the information requests mentioned one or more substances. Radiation was inquired about most frequently (n = 88; 45%), followed by KI (n = 86; 44%) and other iodine/iodide products (n = 47; 24%). Of the 60 reported exposures, KI was reported most frequently (n = 25; 42%), followed by radiation (n = 22; 37%) and other iodine/iodide products (n = 13; 22%). Among reported KI exposures, most were classified as probable exposures (n = 24; 96%); one was a probable non-exposure. Among reported other iodine/iodide product exposures, most were probable exposures (n = 10, 77%) and the rest were suspect exposures (n = 3; 23%). The reported radiation exposures were classified as suspect exposures (n = 16, 73%) or probable non-exposures (n = 6; 27%). No radiation exposures were classified as probable exposures. A small number of the probable exposures to KI and other iodide/iodine products reported adverse signs or symptoms (n = 9; 26%). The majority of probable exposures had no adverse outcomes (n = 28; 82%). These data identified a potential public health information gap regarding KI and other iodine/iodide products which was then addressed through public health messaging activities. CONCLUSION: During the Japan incident response, surveillance activities using NPDS identified KI and other iodine/iodide products as potential public health concerns within the US, which guided CDC's public health messaging and communication activities. Regional PCs can provide timely and additional information during a public health emergency to enhance data collected from surveillance activities, which in turn can be used to inform public health decision-making.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: We explored how variance in HIV infection is distributed across multiple geographical scales among people who inject drugs (PWID) in the United States, overall and within racial/ethnic groups. METHODS: People who inject drugs (n = 9077) were recruited via respondent-driven sampling from 19 metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 2009 National HIV Behavioral Surveillance system. We used multilevel modeling to determine the percentage of variance in HIV infection explained by zip codes, counties, and MSAs where PWID lived, overall and for specific racial/ethnic groups. RESULTS: Collectively, zip codes, counties, and MSAs explained 29% of variance in HIV infection. Within specific racial/ethnic groups, all 3 scales explained variance in HIV infection among non-Hispanic/Latino White PWID (4.3%, 0.2%, and 7.5%, respectively), MSAs explained variance among Hispanic/Latino PWID (10.1%), and counties explained variance among non-Hispanic/Latino Black PWID (6.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to potential determinants of HIV infection at zip codes, counties, and MSAs may vary for different racial/ethnic groups of PWID, and may reveal opportunities to identify and ameliorate intraracial inequities in exposure to determinants of HIV infection at these geographical scales.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rabies is a fatal encephalitis caused by lyssaviruses. Evidence of lyssavirus circulation has recently emerged in Southeast Asian bats. A cross-sectional study was conducted in Thailand to assess rabies-related knowledge and practices among persons regularly exposed to bats and bat habitats. The objectives were to identify deficiencies in rabies awareness, describe the occurrence of bat exposures, and explore factors associated with transdermal bat exposures. METHODS: A survey was administered to a convenience sample of adult guano miners, bat hunters, game wardens, and residents/personnel at Buddhist temples where mass bat roosting occurs. The questionnaire elicited information on demographics, experience with bat exposures, and rabies knowledge. Participants were also asked to describe actions they would take in response to a bat bite as well as actions for a bite from a potentially rabid animal. Bivariate analysis was used to compare responses between groups and multivariable logistic regression was used to explore factors independently associated with being bitten or scratched by a bat. FINDINGS: Of 106 people interviewed, 11 (10%) identified bats as a potential source of rabies. A history of a bat bite or scratch was reported by 29 (27%), and 38 (36%) stated either that they would do nothing or that they did not know what they would do in response to a bat bite. Guano miners were less likely than other groups to indicate animal bites as a mechanism of rabies transmission (68% vs. 90%, p = 0.03) and were less likely to say they would respond appropriately to a bat bite or scratch (61% vs. 27%, p = 0.003). Guano mining, bat hunting, and being in a bat cave or roost area more than 5 times a year were associated with history of a bat bite or scratch. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate the need for educational outreach to raise awareness of bat rabies, promote exposure prevention, and ensure appropriate health-seeking behaviors for bat-inflicted wounds, particularly among at-risk groups in Thailand.",

METHODS: We identified 4,824 women aged 18 to 64 years with the index Pap test results of LSIL, HSIL, or ASC-H from health insurance claims in a large U.S. health care organization and who had a routine Pap test in 2004. We used a survival regression model to estimate factors related to the length of time (days) from the index Pap test to a follow-up colposcopy. RESULTS: The expected length of time from an abnormal Pap test to a colposcopy differed by age and Pap test result. For women with an ASC-H result, those who were older were more likely to delay colposcopy compared with the younger women. For women with LSIL and HSIL results, the timing of colposcopy did not differ by age; however, the time was shorter compared with ASC-H. We found that physician specialties, health care settings, and area-level racial and ethnic density were related to timing of receiving follow-up procedures after an abnormal index Pap test result. CONCLUSION: Women with LSIL and HSIL received a colposcopy in 3-4 months, but women with ASC-H were more likely to receive the procedure at a later time. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: I.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To examine racial differences in tibiofemoral joint (TFJ) and patellofemoral joint (PFJ) radiographic osteoarthritis in African-American (AA) and Caucasian men and women. METHOD: Multiple logistic regression was used to evaluate cross-sectional associations between race and tibiofemoral osteoarthritis (TF-OA) and the presence, severity and location of individual radiographic features of tibiofemoral joint osteoarthritis [TFJ-OA] (osteophytes, joint space narrowing [JSN], sclerosis and cysts) and patellofemoral joint osteoarthritis (PFJ-OA) (osteophytes, JSN and sclerosis), using data from the Johnston County Osteoarthritis Project. Proportional odds ratios (POR) assessed severity of TF-OA, TFJ and PFJ osteophytes, and JSN, adjusting for confounders. Generalized estimating equations accounted for auto-correlation of knees. RESULTS: Among 3187 participants (32.5% AAs; 62% women; mean age 62 years), 6300 TFJ and 1957 PFJ were included. Compared to Caucasians, AA men were more likely to have TF-OA (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]=1.36; 95% CI, 1.00-1.86); tri-compartmental TFJ and PFJ osteophytes (aOR=3.06; 95%CI=1.96-4.78), and TFJ and PFJ sclerosis. AA women were more likely than Caucasian to have medial TFJ and tri-compartmental osteophytes (aOR=2.13; 1.55-2.94), and lateral TFJ sclerosis. AAs had more severe TF-OA than Caucasians (adjusted cumulative odds ratio [aPOR]=2.08; 95% CI, 1.19-3.64 for men; aPOR=1.56; 95% CI, 1.06-2.29 for women) and were more likely to have lateral TFJ JSN. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to Caucasians, AAs were more likely to have more severe TF-OA; tri-compartmental disease; and lateral JSN. Further research to clarify the discrepancy between radiographic features in OA among races appears warranted.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: We examined HIV transmission potential of patients in care by analyzing the amount of person-time spent above a viral load threshold that increases risk for transmission. DESIGN: Observational cohort and supplemental data. METHODS: The cohort included HIV patients who received care at six HIV clinics in the United States, from 1 April 2009 to 31 March 2013, and had two or more viral load tests during this interval. Person-time (in days) above a viral load of 1500 copies/ml out of the total observation time was determined by inspecting consecutive pairs of viral load results and the time intervals between those pairs. The person-time rate ratios comparing demographic and clinical subgroups were estimated with Poisson regression. RESULTS: The cohort included 14 532 patients observed for a median of 1073 days with a median of nine viral load records. Ninety percent of the patients had been prescribed antiretroviral therapy. On average, viral load exceeded 1500 copies/ml during 23% of the patients' observation time (average of 84 days per year, per patient). Percentage of person-time above the threshold was higher among patients who had more than a fourth of their viral load pairs exceeding a 6-month interval (34% of observation time), patients not on antiretroviral therapy (58% of time), new/re-engaging patients (34% of time), patients 16-39 years of age (32% of time), and patients of black race (26% of time). CONCLUSION: HIV patients in care spent an average of nearly a quarter of their time with viral loads above 1500 copies/ml, higher among some subgroups, placing them at risk for potentially transmitting HIV to others.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The burden of the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza might be underestimated if detection of the virus is mandated to diagnose infection. Using an alternate approach, we propose that a much higher pandemic burden was experienced in our institution. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Consecutive patients (n = 2588) presenting to our hospital with influenza like illness (ILI) or severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) during a 1-year period (May 2009-April 2010) were prospectively recruited and tested for influenza A by real-time RT-PCR. Analysis of weekly trends showed an 11-fold increase in patients presenting with ILI/SARI during the peak pandemic period when compared with the pre-pandemic period and a significant (P<0.001) increase in SARI admissions during the pandemic period (30+/-15.9 admissions/week) when compared with pre-pandemic (7+/-2.5) and post-pandemic periods (5+/-3.8). However, Influenza A was detected in less than one-third of patients with ILI/SARI [699 (27.0%)]; a majority of these (557/699, 79.7%) were Pandemic (H1N1)2009 virus [A/H1N1/09]. An A/H1N1/09 positive test was correlated with shorter symptom duration prior to presentation (p = 0.03). More ILI cases tested positive for A/H1N1/09 when compared with SARI (27.4% vs. 14.6%, P = 0.037). When the entire study population was considered, A/H1N1/09 positivity was associated with lower risk of hospitalization (p<0.0001) and ICU admission (p = 0.013) suggesting mild self-limiting illness in a majority. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Analysis of weekly trends of ILI/SARI suggest a higher burden of the pandemic attributable to A/H1N1/09 than estimates assessed by a positive PCR test alone. The study highlights methodological consideration in the estimation of burden of pandemic influenza in developing countries using hospital-based data that may help assess the impact of future outbreaks of respiratory illnesses.",

        "abstract": "SUMMARY: Plague is thought to have killed millions during three catastrophic pandemics. Primary pneumonic plague, the most severe form of the disease, is transmissible from person-to-person and has the potential for propagating epidemics. Efforts to quantify its transmission potential have relied on published data from large outbreaks, an approach that artificially inflates the basic reproductive number (R0) and skews the distribution of individual infectiousness. Using data for all primary pneumonic plague cases reported in the USA from 1900 to 2009, we determined that the majority of cases will fail to transmit, even in the absence of antimicrobial treatment or prophylaxis. Nevertheless, potential for sustained outbreaks still exists due to superspreading events. These findings challenge current concepts regarding primary pneumonic plague transmission.",

        "abstract": "Background: Bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (bOPV; types 1 and 3) is expected to replace trivalent OPV (tOPV) globally by April, 2016, preceded by the introduction of at least one dose of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) in routine immunisation programmes to eliminate vaccine-associated or vaccine-derived poliomyelitis from serotype 2 poliovirus. Because data are needed on sequential IPV-bOPV schedules, we assessed the immunogenicity of two different IPV-bOPV schedules compared with an all-IPV schedule in infants. Methods: We did a randomised, controlled, open-label, non-inferiority trial with healthy, full-term (>25 kg birthweight) infants aged 8 weeks (+/- 7 days) at six well-child clinics in Santiago, Chile. We used supplied lists to randomly assign infants (1:1:1) to receive three polio vaccinations (IPV by injection or bOPV as oral drops) at age 8, 16, and 24 weeks in one of three sequential schedules: IPV-bOPV-bOPV, IPV-IPV-bOPV, or IPV-IPV-IPV. We did the randomisation with blocks of 12 stratified by study site. All analyses were done in a masked manner. Co-primary outcomes were non-inferiority of the bOPV-containing schedules compared with the all-IPV schedule for seroconversion (within a 10% margin) and antibody titres (within two-thirds log2 titres) to poliovirus serotypes 1 and 3 at age 28 weeks, analysed in the per-protocol population. Secondary outcomes were seroconversion and titres to serotype 2 and faecal shedding for 4 weeks after a monovalent OPV type 2 challenge at age 28 weeks. Safety analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01841671, and is closed to new participants. Findings: Between April 25 and August 1, 2013, we assigned 570 infants to treatment: 190 to IPV-bOPV-bOPV, 192 to IPV-IPV-bOPV, and 188 to IPV-IPV-IPV. 564 (99%) were vaccinated and included in the intention-to-treat cohort, and 537 (94%) in the per-protocol analyses. In the IPV-bOPV-bOPV, IPV-IPV-bOPV, and IPV-IPV-IPV groups, respectively, the proportions of children with seroconversion to type 1 poliovirus were 166 (988%) of 168, 95% CI 958-997; 178 (100%), 979-1000; and 175 (100%), 979-1000. Proportions with seroconvsion to type 3 poliovirus were 163 (982%) of 166, 948-994; 177 (100%), 979-1000, and 172 (989%) of 174, 959-997. Non-inferiority was thus shown for the bOPV-containing schedules compared with the all-IPV schedule, with no significant differences between groups. In the IPV-bOPV-bOPV, IPV-IPV-bOPV, and IPV-IPV-IPV groups, respectively, the proportions of children with seroprotective antibody titres to type 1 poliovirus were 168 (988%) of 170, 95% CI 958-997; 181 (100%), 979-1000; and 177 (100%), 979-1000. Proportions to type 3 poliovirus were 166 (982%) of 169, 949-994; 180 (100%), 979-1000; and 174 (989%) of 176, 960-997. Non-inferiority comparisons could not be done for this outcome because median titres for the groups receiving OPV were greater than the assay's upper limit of detection (log2 titres >105). The proportions of children seroconverting to type 2 poliovirus in the IPV-bOPV-bOPV, IPV-IPV-bOPV, and IPV-IPV-IPV groups, respectively, were 130 (774%) of 168, 95% CI 705-830; 169 (960%) of 176, 920-980; and 175 (100%), 978-100. IPV-bOPV schedules resulted in almost a 03 log reduction of type 2 faecal shedding compared with the IPV-only schedule. No participants died during the trial; 81 serious adverse events were reported, of which one was thought to be possibly vaccine-related (intestinal intussusception). Interpretation: Seroconversion rates against polioviruses types 1 and 3 were non-inferior in sequential schedules containing IPV and bOPV, compared with an all-IPV schedule, and proportions of infants with protective antibodies were high after all three schedules. One or two doses of bOPV after IPV boosted intestinal immunity for poliovirus type 2, suggesting possible cross protection. Additionally, there was evidence of humoral priming for type 2 from one dose of IPV. Our findings could give policy makers flexibility when choo ing a vaccination schedule, especially when trying to eliminate vaccine-associated and vaccine-derived poliomyelitis.

        "abstract": "A relatively high number of different subsets of B-cells are generated through the differentiation of early B-cell precursors into mature B-lymphocytes in the bone marrow (BM) and antigen-triggered maturation of germinal center B-cells into memory B-lymphocytes and plasmablasts in lymphoid tissues. These B-cell subpopulations, which are produced in the BM and lymphoid tissues, recirculate through peripheral blood (PB), into different tissues including mucosa and the BM, where long-living plasma cells produce antibodies. These circulating PB B-cells can be classified according to their maturation stage into i) immature/transitional, ii) naive, and iii) memory B-lymphocytes, and iv) plasmablasts/plasma cells. Additionally, unique subsets of memory B-lymphocytes and plasmablasts/plasma cells can be identified based on their differential expression of unique Ig-heavy chain isotypes (e.g.: IgM, IgD, IgG, IgA). In the present paper, we review recent data reported in the literature about the distribution, immunophenotypic and functional characteristics of these cell subpopulations, as well as their distribution in PB according to age and seasonal changes. Additional information is also provided in this regard based on the study of a population-based cohort of 600 healthy adults aged from 20 to 80 years, recruited in the Salamanca area in western Spain. Detailed knowledge of the distribution and traffic of B-cell subsets through PB mirrors the immune status of an individual subject and it may also contribute to a better understanding of B-cell disorders related to B-cell biology and homeostasis, such as monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL).",

When mothers wean, they are challenged to provide an adequate replacement diet. This study investigates the use and acceptability of a lipid-based nutrient supplement (LNS) as a breast-milk substitute when provided to infants (6-12mo) of HIV-positive mothers, as part of the Breast-feeding, Antiretroviral, and Nutrition (BAN) Study. A sub-sample of mothers (n = 45) participated in interviews that explored EBF, weaning, and strategies to feed LNS. Mothers reported several weaning strategies, including gradual reduction of breast-feeding, expressing breast-milk into a cup, and separation of mother and child. LNS, a peanut-based micronutrient fortified paste, was highly accepted and incorporated into the traditional diet. Weaning is a feasible HIV prevention method among this population in Malawi when supported by the provision of LNS as a breast-milk substitute.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) presents unique diagnostic and management challenges. Personality may be a risk factor for CFS and may contribute to the maintenance of the illness. METHODS: 501 study participants were identified from the general population of Georgia: 113 people with CFS, 264 with unexplained unwellness but not CFS (insufficient fatigue, ISF) and 124 well controls. We used the Personality Diagnostic Questionnaire, 4th edition, to evaluate DSM-IV personality disorders. We used the NEO Five-Factor Inventory to assess personality features (neuroticism, extraversion, openness, agreeableness and conscientiousness). The Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory measured 5 dimensions of fatigue, and the Medical Outcomes Survey Short Form 36 measured 8 dimensions of functional impairment. RESULTS: Twenty-nine percent of the CFS cases had at least 1 personality disorder, compared to 28% of the ISF cases and 7% of the well controls. The prevalence of paranoid, schizoid, avoidant, obsessive-compulsive and depressive personality disorders were significantly higher in CFS and ISF compared to the well controls. The CFS cases had significantly higher scores on neuroticism, and significantly lower scores on extraversion than those with ISF or the well controls. Personality features were correlated with selected composite characteristics of fatigue. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that CFS is associated with an increased prevalence of maladaptive personality features and personality disorders. This might be associated with being noncompliant with treatment suggestions, displaying unhealthy behavioral strategies and lacking a stable social environment. Since maladaptive personality is not specific to CFS, it might be associated with illness per se rather than with a specific condition.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: A systematic review and a meta-analysis were performed to determine the association between public smoking bans and risk for hospital admission for acute myocardial infarction (AMI). BACKGROUND: Secondhand smoke (SHS) is associated with a 30% increase in risk of AMI, which might be reduced by prohibiting smoking in work and public places. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, and Google Scholar databases plus bibliographies of relevant studies and reviews were searched for peer-reviewed original articles published from January 1, 2004, through April 30, 2009, using the search terms \"smoking ban\" and \"heart\" or \"myocardial infarct.\" Investigators supplied additional data. All published peer-reviewed original studies identified were included. Incidence rates of AMI per 100,000 person-years before and after implementation of the smoking bans and incidence rate ratios (IRRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Random effects meta-analyses estimated the overall effect of the smoking bans. Funnel plot and meta-regression assessed heterogeneity among studies. RESULTS: Using 11 reports from 10 study locations, AMI risk decreased by 17% overall (IRR: 0.83, 95% CI: 0.75 to 0.92), with the greatest effect among younger individuals and nonsmokers. The IRR incrementally decreased 26% for each year of observation after ban implementation. CONCLUSIONS: Smoking bans in public places and workplaces are significantly associated with a reduction in AMI incidence, particularly if enforced over several years.",

        "abstract": "SETTING: Fifteen human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) clinics in Nyanza Region, Western Kenya. OBJECTIVE: To describe routine tuberculosis (TB) screening and diagnostic practices among newly enrolled people living with HIV (PLHIV) prior to the implementation of World Health Organization recommended TB intensified case finding. DESIGN: Retrospective chart abstraction of PLHIV aged 7 years who were newly enrolled in HIV care in July and August 2009, and who had not received antiretroviral treatment in the preceding 2 years or been diagnosed with TB in the previous year. Factors associated with evidence of TB diagnostic evaluation among symptomatic PLHIV were assessed. RESULTS: Of 1020 patients included in the analysis, 995 (98%) were screened for TB at enrolment and 613 (62%) reported TB symptoms. Ninety-six (16%) patients with symptoms had evidence of referral for TB diagnostic evaluation, including patients at large clinics, those with advanced HIV disease and those reporting multiple TB symptoms. Among the 43 (45%) with documented evaluation results, 26 (60%) were diagnosed with TB. CONCLUSION: Although most PLHIV were screened for TB, very few underwent an evaluation, and the proportion diagnosed with TB was very low. Efforts to improve TB screening should focus on standardizing the intensified case finding algorithm and linkage to, and adequate infrastructure for, TB diagnostic evaluation.",

The recommendations outline how to provide quality family planning services, which include contraceptive services, pregnancy testing and counseling, helping clients achieve pregnancy, basic infertility services, preconception health services, and sexually transmitted disease services. The primary audience for this report is all current or potential providers of family planning services, including those working in service sites that are dedicated to family planning service delivery as well as private and public providers of more comprehensive primary care.The United States continues to face substantial challenges to improving the reproductive health of the U.S. population. Nearly one half of all pregnancies are unintended, with more than 700,000 adolescents aged 15-19 years becoming pregnant each year and more than 300,000 giving birth. One of eight pregnancies in the United States results in preterm birth, and infant mortality rates remain high compared with those of other developed countries. This report can assist primary care providers in offering family planning services that will help women, men, and couples achieve their desired number and spacing of children and increase the likelihood that those children are born healthy. The report provides recommendations for how to help prevent and achieve pregnancy, emphasizes offering a full range of contraceptive methods for persons seeking to prevent pregnancy, highlights the special needs of adolescent clients, and encourages the use of the family planning visit to provide selected preventive health services for women, in accordance with the recommendations for women issued by the Institute of Medicine and adopted by HHS.",

        "keywords": "IMPORTANCE: Vaccination errors are preventable events. Errors can have impacts including inadequate immunological protection, possible injury, cost, inconvenience, and reduced confidence in the healthcare delivery system. OBJECTIVES: To describe vaccination error reports submitted to the vaccine adverse event reporting system (VAERS) and identify opportunities for prevention. METHODS: We conducted descriptive analyses using data from VAERS, the U.S. spontaneous surveillance system for adverse events following immunization. The VAERS database was searched from 2000 through 2013 for U.S. reports describing vaccination errors and categorized reports into 11 error groups. We analyzed numbers and types of vaccination error reports, vaccines involved, reporting trends over time, and descriptions of errors for selected reports. RESULTS: We identified 20,585 vaccination error reports documenting 21,843 errors. Annual reports increased from 10 in 2000 to 4324 in 2013. The most common error group was \"Inappropriate Schedule\" (5947; 27%); human papillomavirus (quadrivalent) (1516) and rotavirus (880) vaccines were most frequently involved. \"Storage and Dispensing\" errors (4983; 23%) included mostly expired vaccine administered (2746) and incorrect storage of vaccine (2202). \"Wrong Vaccine Administered\" errors (3372; 15%) included mix-ups between vaccines with similar antigens such as varicella/herpes zoster (shingles), DTaP/Tdap, and pneumococcal conjugate/polysaccharide. For error reports with an adverse health event (5204; 25% of total), 92% were classified as non-serious. We also identified 936 vaccination error clusters (i.e., same error, multiple patients, in a common setting) involving over 6141 patients. The most common error in clusters was incorrect storage of vaccine (582 clusters and more than 1715 patients). CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination error reports to VAERS have increased substantially. Contributing factors might include changes in reporting practices, increasing complexity of the immunization schedule, availability of products with similar sounding names or acronyms, and increased attention to storage and temperature lapses. Prevention strategies should be considered.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: From August to December 2011, a multidisciplinary group with expertise in mathematical modeling was constituted by the GAVI Alliance and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to estimate the impact of vaccination in 73 countries supported by the GAVI Alliance. METHODS: The number of deaths averted in persons projected to be vaccinated during 2011-2020 was estimated for ten antigens: hepatitis B, yellow fever, Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib), Streptococcus pneumoniae, rotavirus, Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A, Japanese encephalitis, human papillomavirus, measles, and rubella. Impact was calculated as the difference in the number of deaths expected over the lifetime of vaccinated cohorts compared to the number of deaths expected in those cohorts with no vaccination. Numbers of persons vaccinated were based on 2011 GAVI Strategic Demand Forecasts with projected dates of vaccine introductions, vaccination coverage, and target population size in each country. RESULTS: By 2020, nearly all GAVI-supported countries with endemic disease are projected to have introduced hepatitis B, Hib, pneumococcal, rotavirus, rubella, yellow fever, N. meningitidis serogroup A, and Japanese encephalitis-containing vaccines; 55 (75 percent) countries are projected to have introduced human papillomavirus vaccine. Projected use of these vaccines during 2011-2020 is expected to avert an estimated 9.9 million deaths. Routine and supplementary immunization activities with measles vaccine are expected to avert an additional 13.4 million deaths. Estimated numbers of deaths averted per 1000 persons vaccinated were highest for first-dose measles (16.5), human papillomavirus (15.1), and hepatitis B (8.3) vaccination. Approximately 52 percent of the expected deaths averted will be in Africa, 27 percent in Southeast Asia, and 13 percent in the Eastern Mediterranean. CONCLUSION: Vaccination of persons during 2011-2020 in 73 GAVI-eligible countries is expected to have substantial public health impact, particularly in Africa and Southeast Asia, two regions with high mortality. The actual impact of vaccination in these countries may be higher than our estimates because several widely used antigens were not included in the analysis. The quality of our estimates is limited by lack of data on underlying disease burden and vaccine effectiveness against fatal disease outcomes in developing countries. We plan to update the estimates annually to reflect updated demand forecasts, to refine model assumptions based on results of new information, and to extend the analysis to include morbidity and economic benefits.",

        "abstract": "CONTEXT: Recent recommendations from the American Heart Association aim to improve cardiovascular health by encouraging the general population to meet 7 cardiovascular health metrics: not smoking; being physically active; having normal blood pressure, blood glucose and total cholesterol levels, and weight; and eating a healthy diet. OBJECTIVE: To examine time trends in cardiovascular health metrics and to estimate joint associations and population-attributable fractions of these metrics in relation to all-cause and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality risk. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Study of a nationally representative sample of 44,959 US adults (>/=20 years), using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1988-1994, 1999-2004, and 2005-2010 and the NHANES III Linked Mortality File (through 2006). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: All-cause, CVD, and ischemic heart disease (IHD) mortality. RESULTS: Few participants met all 7 cardiovascular health metrics (2.0% [95% CI, 1.5%-2.5%] in 1988-1994, 1.2% [95% CI, 0.8%-1.9%] in 2005-2010). Among NHANES III participants, 2673 all-cause, 1085 CVD, and 576 IHD deaths occurred (median follow-up, 14.5 years). Among participants who met 1 or fewer cardiovascular health metrics, age- and sex-standardized absolute risks were 14.8 (95% CI, 13.2-16.5) deaths per 1000 person-years for all-cause mortality, 6.5 (95% CI, 5.5-7.6) for CVD mortality, and 3.7 (95% CI, 2.8-4.5) for IHD mortality. Among those who met 6 or more metrics, corresponding risks were 5.4 (95% CI, 3.6-7.3) for all-cause mortality, 1.5 (95% CI, 0.5-2.5) for CVD mortality, and 1.1 (95% CI, 0.7-2.0) for IHD mortality. Adjusted hazard ratios were 0.49 (95% CI, 0.33-0.74) for all-cause mortality, 0.24 (95% CI, 0.13-0.47) for CVD mortality, and 0.30 (95% CI, 0.13-0.68) for IHD mortality, comparing participants who met 6 or more vs 1 or fewer cardiovascular health metrics. Adjusted population-attributable fractions were 59% (95% CI, 33%-76%) for all-cause mortality, 64% (95% CI, 28%-84%) for CVD mortality, and 63% (95% CI, 5%-89%) for IHD mortality. CONCLUSION: Meeting a greater number of cardiovascular health metrics was associated with a lower risk of total and CVD mortality, but the prevalence of meeting all 7 cardiovascular health metrics was low in the study population.",

A comparison of 60-day case-fatality rates and clinical characteristics of patients given a diagnosis on or before October 4, the date the outbreak was widely publicized, with those of patients given a diagnosis after October 4 showed that an estimated 3,150 MPA injections, 153 cases of meningitis or stroke, and 124 deaths were averted. Compared with diagnosis after October 4, diagnosis on or before October 4 was significantly associated with a higher 60-day case-fatality rate (28% vs. 5%; p<0.0001).

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine epidemiological patterns in diagnoses of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and prevalence among females by age, race/ethnicity and transmission category, and essential steps in the continuum of HIV care. METHODS: Using data from the National HIV Surveillance System, we estimated the number of females aged 13 years or older diagnosed with HIV infection in 2008 through 2012 and living with HIV at the end of 2011 in the United States. We determined percentages of females linked to care, retained in care, and virally suppressed in 18 jurisdictions with complete reporting of CD4 and viral load test results. RESULTS: From 2008 to 2012, the estimated rate of HIV diagnoses among females decreased from 9.3 to 6.9 per 100,000 (-7.1% per year; 95% confidence interval [CI], -7.9, -6.3). In 2012, the diagnosis rate was highest among Blacks/African Americans (35.7), followed by Hispanics or Latinos (6.4), and Native Hawaiian Other Pacific Islander (5.1), and lowest among Whites (1.8). Most females diagnosed in 2012 were linked to care within 3 months of diagnosis (82.5%). About one-half (52.4%) of females living with HIV in 2011 received ongoing care in 2011 and 44.3% had a suppressed viral load. Viral suppression was lower among American Indian/Alaska Native (29.7%) and Black/African American (41.6%) compared with White females (46.5%). The percentage in care and with viral suppression was lower among younger compared with older females. CONCLUSION: HIV diagnoses continue to decrease among females; however, disparities exist in HIV burden and viral suppression. Improvements in care and treatment outcomes are needed for all women with particular emphasis on younger women.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To quantify the effect of the introduction of 20 mph (32 km an hour) traffic speed zones on road collisions, injuries, and fatalities in London. DESIGN: Observational study based on analysis of geographically coded police data on road casualties, 1986-2006. Analyses were made of longitudinal changes in counts of road injuries within each of 119 029 road segments with at least one casualty with conditional fixed effects Poisson models. Estimates of the effect of introducing 20 mph zones on casualties within those zones and in adjacent areas were adjusted for the underlying downward trend in traffic casualties. SETTING: London. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: All casualties from road collisions; those killed and seriously injured (KSI). RESULTS: The introduction of 20 mph zones was associated with a 41.9% (95% confidence interval 36.0% to 47.8%) reduction in road casualties, after adjustment for underlying time trends. The percentage reduction was greatest in younger children and greater for the category of killed or seriously injured casualties than for minor injuries. There was no evidence of casualty migration to areas adjacent to 20 mph zones, where casualties also fell slightly by an average of 8.0% (4.4% to 11.5%). CONCLUSIONS: 20 mph zones are effective measures for reducing road injuries and deaths.",

        "abstract": "In this study the emergence of rotavirus A genotype G12 in children <5 years of age is reported from Cameroon during 2010/2011. A total of 135 human stool samples were P and G genotyped by reverse transcriptase PCR. Six different rotavirus VP7 genotypes were detected, including G1, G2, G3, G8, G9, and G12 in combinations with P[4], P[6] and P[8] VP4 genotypes. Genotype G12 predominated in combination with P[8] (54.1%) and P[6] (10.4%) genotypes followed by G1P[6] (8.2%), G3P[6] (6.7%), G2P[4] (5.9%), G8P[6] (3.7%), G2P[6] (0.7%), G3P[8] (0.7%), and G9P[8] (0.7%). Genotype P[6] strains in combination with various G-types represented a substantial proportion (N = 44, 32.6%) of the genotyped strains. Partially typed strains included G12P[NT] (2.2%); G3P[NT] (0.7%); G(NT)P[6] (1.5%); and G(NT)P[8] (0.7%). Mixed infections were found in five specimens (3.7%) in several combinations including G1 + G12P[6], G2 + G3P[6] + P[8], G3 + G8P[6], G3 + G12P[6] + P[8], and G12P[6] + P[8]. The approximately 10% relative frequency of G12P[6] strains detected in this study suggests that this strain is emerging in Cameroon and should be monitored carefully as rotavirus vaccine is implemented in this country, as it shares neither G- nor P-type specificity with strains in the RotaTeq(R) and Rotarix(R) vaccines. These findings are consistent with other recent reports of the global spread and increasing epidemiologic importance of G12 and P[6] strains.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND:  Homozygous loss-of-function mutations in TREM2, encoding the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 protein, have previously been associated with an autosomal recessive form of early-onset dementia. METHODS:  We used genome, exome, and Sanger sequencing to analyze the genetic variability in TREM2 in a series of 1092 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 1107 controls (the discovery set). We then performed a meta-analysis on imputed data for the TREM2 variant rs75932628 (predicted to cause a R47H substitution) from three genomewide association studies of Alzheimer's disease and tested for the association of the variant with disease. We genotyped the R47H variant in an additional 1887 cases and 4061 controls. We then assayed the expression of TREM2 across different regions of the human brain and identified genes that are differentially expressed in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease and in control mice. RESULTS:  We found significantly more variants in exon 2 of TREM2 in patients with Alzheimer's disease than in controls in the discovery set (P=0.02). There were 22 variant alleles in 1092 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 5 variant alleles in 1107 controls (P<0.001). The most commonly associated variant, rs75932628 (encoding R47H), showed highly significant association with Alzheimer's disease (P<0.001). Meta-analysis of rs75932628 genotypes imputed from genomewide association studies confirmed this association (P=0.002), as did direct genotyping of an additional series of 1887 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 4061 controls (P<0.001). Trem2 expression differed between control mice and a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. CONCLUSIONS:  Heterozygous rare variants in TREM2 are associated with a significant increase in the risk of Alzheimer's disease. (Funded by Alzheimer's Research UK and others.).",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rotavirus vaccine introduction in the US in 2006 led to substantial declines in rotavirus detections during 2007-2010. To further evaluate the long-term impact of the vaccine program, we assessed trends in rotavirus testing and detection in the 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 seasons compared with pre-vaccine seasons from 2000-2006. METHODS: We examined data from July 2000 to June 2012 from 50-70 laboratories reporting to the National Respiratory and Enteric Viruses Surveillance System to compare rotavirus season timing and peak activity in the pre- and post-vaccine introduction eras. We restricted the analyses to 25 laboratories that consistently reported for >/=26 weeks for each season from 2000-2012 to assess trends in rotavirus testing and detection. RESULTS: The threshold for the start of the rotavirus season was never achieved nationally during the 2011-2012 season and the 2010-2011 season was 8 weeks shorter in duration than the pre-vaccine baseline. During these seasons, nationally, the number of positive rotavirus tests declined 74%-90% compared with the pre-vaccine baseline and the total number of tests performed annually declined 28%-36%. The annual proportion positive at the 25 consistently reporting laboratories remained below 10% in both seasons compared with a pre-vaccine baseline median of 26%. A pattern of biennial increases in rotavirus activity emerged during the 5 post-vaccine seasons from 2007-2012, but activity remained substantially below pre-vaccine levels. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial and sustained decline in rotavirus activity below the pre-vaccine baseline was observed in all 5 post-vaccine introduction years, affirming the long-term health benefits of the US rotavirus vaccination program.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccination is important for preventing disease outbreaks, yet pockets of under-vaccination persist. Text message reminders have been employed successfully for other pediatric vaccines, but studies examining their use for MMR vaccination are limited. This study assessed the impact of text message reminders on timely MMR vaccination. STUDY DESIGN: Parents (n=2054) of 9.5-10.5-month-old children from four urban academically-affiliated pediatric clinics were randomized to scheduling plus appointment text message reminders, appointment text message reminder-only, or usual care. The former included up to three text reminders to schedule the one-year preventive care visit. Both text messaging arms included a text reminder sent 2 days before that visit. Outcomes included appointment scheduling, appointment attendance, and MMR vaccination by age 13 months, the standard of care at study sites. RESULTS: Children of parents in the scheduling plus appointment text message reminders arm were more likely to have a scheduled one-year visit than those in the other arms (71.9% vs. 67.4%, relative risk ratio (RRR) 1.07 [95% CI 1.005-1.13]), particularly if no appointment was scheduled before randomization (i.e., no baseline appointment) (62.1% vs. 54.7%, RRR 1.14 [95% CI 1.04-1.24]). One-year visit attendance and timely MMR vaccination were similar between arms. However, among children without a baseline appointment, those with parents in the scheduling plus appointment text message reminders arm were more likely to undergo timely MMR vaccination (61.1% vs. 55.1%, RRR 1.11 [95% CI 1.01-1.21]). CONCLUSION: Text message reminders improved timely MMR vaccination of high-risk children without a baseline one-year visit.",

        "abstract": "In August 2012, a wildlife biologist became ill immediately following a 6-wk field trip to collect bats and rodents in South Sudan and Uganda. After returning to the US, the biologist was admitted to the hospital with multiple symptoms including fever, malaise, headache, generalized myalgia and arthralgia, stiffness in the neck, and sore throat. Soon after admission, the patient developed a maculopapular rash and oropharynx ulcerations. The patient remained hospitalized for 14 d. Several suspect pathogens, including viral hemorrhagic fever viruses such as Ebola viruses and Marburg viruses, were ruled out through standard diagnostic testing. However, deep sequencing and metagenomic analyses identified a novel paramyxovirus, later named Sosuga virus, in the patient's blood. To determine the potential source, bat tissues collected during the 3-wk period just prior to the onset of symptoms were tested for Sosuga virus, and several Egyptian rousette bats (Rousettus aegyptiacus) were found to be positive. Further analysis of archived Egyptian rousette tissues collected at other localities in Uganda found additional Sosuga virus-positive bats, suggesting this species could be a potential natural reservoir for this novel paramyxovirus.",

In this survey, we assessed the current status of reproducibility and transparency addressing these indicators in a random sample of 441 biomedical journal articles published in 2000-2014. Only one study provided a full protocol and none made all raw data directly available. Replication studies were rare (n = 4), and only 16 studies had their data included in a subsequent systematic review or meta-analysis. The majority of studies did not mention anything about funding or conflicts of interest. The percentage of articles with no statement of conflict decreased substantially between 2000 and 2014 (94.4% in 2000 to 34.6% in 2014); the percentage of articles reporting statements of conflicts (0% in 2000, 15.4% in 2014) or no conflicts (5.6% in 2000, 50.0% in 2014) increased. Articles published in journals in the clinical medicine category versus other fields were almost twice as likely to not include any information on funding and to have private funding. This study provides baseline data to compare future progress in improving these indicators in the scientific literature.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Brucellosis is uncommon in the United States; however, its circulation among wildlife and domestic cattle has been ongoing in Wyoming. To assess the public health threat of brucellosis circulation among animals, a seroprevalence study was undertaken among workers in professions considered to be at the highest risk for infection. METHODS: A seroprevalence study was undertaken targeting individuals in at-risk professions in the affected area of the state. RESULTS: Seroprevalence among study participants was 14.4%. Veterinarians were the main professional group that demonstrated a statistically significant association with measurable anti-Brucella antibodies. Vaccinating animals with Brucella vaccines was associated with seropositivity. CONCLUSION: The risk to the general public's health from the circulation of Brucella among wildlife and cattle can be attributed primarily to a limited subpopulation at high risk rather than a generally elevated risk.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) experienced atypical outbreaks of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) infection during 2010-2011 in that they affected persons aged >/=15 years in 4 (Bandundu, Bas Congo, Kasai Occidental, and Kinshasa provinces) of the 6 provinces with outbreaks. METHODS: Analyses of cases of WPV1 infection with onset during 2010-2011 by province, age, polio vaccination status, and sex were conducted. The prevalence of antibodies to poliovirus (PV) types 1, 2, and 3 was assessed in sera collected before the outbreaks from women attending antenatal clinics in 3 of the 4 above-mentioned provinces. RESULTS: Of 193 cases of WPV1 infection during 2010-2011, 32 (17%) occurred in individuals aged >/=15 years. Of these 32 cases, 31 (97%) occurred in individuals aged 16-29 years; 9 (28%) were notified in Bandundu, 17 (53%) were notified in Kinshasa, and 22 (69%) had an unknown polio vaccination status. In the seroprevalence assessment, PV type 1 and 3 seroprevalence was lower among women aged 15-29 years in Bandundu and Kinshasa, compared with those in Kasai Occidental. Seropositivity to PVs was associated with increasing age, more pregnancies, and a younger age at first pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: This spatiotemporal analysis strongly suggests that the 2010-2011 outbreaks of WPV1 infection affecting young adults were caused by a PV type 1 immunity gap in Kinshasa and Bandundu due to insufficient exposure to PV type 1 through natural infection or vaccination. Poliovirus immunity gaps in this age group likely persist in DRC.",

        "abstract": "Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection imposes a heavy health burden worldwide and is common in the United States. Previous investigations of risks address environmental and host behavioral/lifestyle factors, but host genetic factors have not been examined. We assessed strength of associations between anti-HEV IgG seropositivity indicating past or recent HEV infection and human genetic variants among three major racial/ethnic populations in the United States, involving 2434 non-Hispanic whites, 1919 non-Hispanic blacks, and 1919 Mexican Americans from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1991-1994. We studied 497 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across 190 genes (particularly those associated with lipid metabolism). Genomic control method was used to adjust for potential population stratification. Non-Hispanic blacks had the lowest seroprevalence of anti-HEV IgG (15.3%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 12.3%-19.0%), compared with non-Hispanic whites (22.3%; 95% CI, 19.1%-25.7%), and Mexican Americans (21.8%; 95% CI, 19.0%-25.3%) (P < 0.01). Non-Hispanic blacks were the only population that showed association between anti-HEV seropositivity and functional epsilon3 and epsilon4 alleles of apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene, encoding apolipoprotein E protein that mediates lipoprotein metabolism. Seropositivity was significantly lower in participants carrying APOE epsilon4 (odds ratio [OR], 0.5; 95%CI, 0.4-0.7; P = 0.00004) and epsilon3 (OR, 0.6; 95%CI, 0.4-0.8; P = 0.001) compared to those carrying APOE epsilon2. No significant associations were observed between other SNPs and anti-HEV seropositivity in non-Hispanic blacks or between any SNPs and anti-HEV seropositivity in non-Hispanic whites or Mexican Americans. CONCLUSION: APOE epsilon3 and epsilon4 are significantly associated with protection against HEV infection in non-Hispanic blacks. Additional studies are needed to understand the basis of protection so that preventive services can be targeted to at-risk persons.",

        "abstract": "Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is a severe infectious disease actively spreading globally, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is an advanced stage of HIV infection. The HIV testing rate, that is, the probability that an AIDS-free HIV infected person seeks a test for HIV during a particular time interval, given no previous positive test has been obtained prior to the start of the time, is an important parameter for public health. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian hierarchical model with two levels of hierarchy to estimate the HIV testing rate using annual AIDS and AIDS-free HIV diagnoses data. At level one, we model the latent number of HIV infections for each year using a Poisson distribution with the intensity parameter representing the HIV incidence rate. At level two, the annual numbers of AIDS and AIDS-free HIV diagnosed cases and all undiagnosed cases stratified by the HIV infections at different years are modeled using a multinomial distribution with parameters including the HIV testing rate. We propose a new class of priors for the HIV incidence rate and HIV testing rate taking into account the temporal dependence of these parameters to improve the estimation accuracy. We develop an efficient posterior computation algorithm based on the adaptive rejection metropolis sampling technique. We demonstrate our model using simulation studies and the analysis of the national HIV surveillance data in the USA. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

        "abstract": "1-Bromopropane (1-BP) has been marketed as an alternative for ozone depleting and other solvents; it is used in aerosol products, adhesives, metal, precision, and electronics cleaning solvents. Mechanisms of toxicity of 1-BP are not fully understood, but it may be a neurological and reproductive toxicant. Sparse exposure information prompted this study using 1-BP air sampling and urinary metabolites. Mercapturic acid conjugates are excreted in urine from 1-BP metabolism involving debromination. Research objectives were to evaluate the utility of urinary N-acetyl-S-(n-propyl)-L-cysteine (AcPrCys) for assessing exposure to 1-BP and compare it to urinary bromide [Br((-))] previously reported for these workers. Forty-eight-hour urine specimens were obtained from 30 workers at two factories where 1-BP spray adhesives were used to construct polyurethane foam seat cushions. Urine specimens were also obtained from 21 unexposed control subjects. All the workers' urine was collected into composite samples representing three time intervals: at work, after work but before bedtime, and upon awakening. Time-weighted average (TWA) geometric mean breathing zone concentrations were 92.4 and 10.5 p.p.m. for spraying and non-spraying jobs, respectively. Urinary AcPrCys showed the same trend as TWA exposures to 1-BP: higher levels were observed for sprayers. Associations of AcPrCys concentrations, adjusted for creatinine, with 1-BP TWA exposure were statistically significant for both sprayers (P < 0.05) and non-sprayers (P < 0.01). Spearman correlation coefficients for AcPrCys and Br((-)) analyses determined from the same urine specimens were highly correlated (P < 0.0001). This study confirms that urinary AcPrCys is an important 1-BP metabolite and an effective biomarker for highly exposed foam cushion workers.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Public health officials must frequently demonstrate the quality and value of public health services, especially during challenging fiscal climates. One of the ways that public health quality and accountability have been demonstrated is through the use of accreditation and standard setting initiatives. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this analysis was to identify existing alignment opportunities between standards established by the Public Health Accreditation Board (PHAB) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC's) public health preparedness (PHP) capabilities in order to optimize and leverage the connections for state and local public health professionals. DESIGN: During March-May 2012, a PHAB/PHP crosswalk was developed by a research team from the CDC's Office for State, Tribal, Local and Territorial Support and Office of Public Health Preparedness and Response's Division of State and Local Readiness to examine the intersection of the PHP capabilities and the PHAB standards. The PHAB/PHP crosswalk used the CDC Public Health Preparedness Capabilities: National Standards for State and Local Planning (PHP Capabilities) and the PHAB Standards and Measures, Version 1.0 (PHAB Standards) as its source documents. To help illustrate the results of the crosswalk, alignment was also depicted through a network graph to transform the results into a visual depiction of the linkages between PHP capabilities and PHAB standards. RESULTS: The most direct links to emergency preparedness were found in PHAB Domains 2 and 5. Opportunities for improved alignment were found throughout the standard documents, particularly in PHAB Domains 3, 8, and 11. The most direct links to accreditation were found in PHP capabilities 1, 2, 3, and 4. CONCLUSIONS: The results highlight the synergy between the infrastructure and foundational elements represented by accreditation and targeted programmatic activities supported by preparedness funding.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: During the spring of 2009, a pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus emerged and spread globally. We describe the clinical characteristics of patients who were hospitalized with 2009 H1N1 influenza in the United States from April 2009 to mid-June 2009. METHODS: Using medical charts, we collected data on 272 patients who were hospitalized for at least 24 hours for influenza-like illness and who tested positive for the 2009 H1N1 virus with the use of a real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction assay. RESULTS: Of the 272 patients we studied, 25% were admitted to an intensive care unit and 7% died. Forty-five percent of the patients were children under the age of 18 years, and 5% were 65 years of age or older. Seventy-three percent of the patients had at least one underlying medical condition; these conditions included asthma; diabetes; heart, lung, and neurologic diseases; and pregnancy. Of the 249 patients who underwent chest radiography on admission, 100 (40%) had findings consistent with pneumonia. Of the 268 patients for whom data were available regarding the use of antiviral drugs, such therapy was initiated in 200 patients (75%) at a median of 3 days after the onset of illness. Data suggest that the use of antiviral drugs was beneficial in hospitalized patients, especially when such therapy was initiated early. CONCLUSIONS: During the evaluation period, 2009 H1N1 influenza caused severe illness requiring hospitalization, including pneumonia and death. Nearly three quarters of the patients had one or more underlying medical conditions. Few severe illnesses were reported among persons 65 years of age or older. Patients seemed to benefit from antiviral therapy.",

        "abstract": "Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of disease and death in the United States, and nearly all tobacco use begins during youth and young adulthood. Among U.S. youths, cigarette smoking has declined in recent years; however, the use of some other tobacco products has increased, and nearly half of tobacco users use two or more tobacco products. CDC analyzed data from the 2013 National Youth Tobacco Survey to determine the prevalence of ever (at least once) and current (at least 1 day in the past 30 days) use of one or more of 10 tobacco products (cigarettes, cigars, hookahs, smokeless tobacco, electronic cigarettes [e-cigarettes], pipes, snus, bidis, kreteks, and dissolvable tobacco) among U.S. middle school (grades 6-8) and high school (grades 9-12) students. In 2013, 22.9% of high school students reported current use of any tobacco product, and 12.6% reported current use of two or more tobacco products; current use of combustible products (i.e., cigarettes, cigars, pipes, bidis, kreteks, and/or hookahs) was substantially greater (20.7%) than use of other types of tobacco. Also, 46.0% of high school students reported having ever tried a tobacco product, and 31.4% reported ever trying two or more tobacco products. Among middle school students, 3.1% reported current use of cigars, and 2.9% reported current use of cigarettes, with non-Hispanic black students more than twice as likely to report current use of cigars than cigarettes. Monitoring the prevalence of the use of all available tobacco products, including new and emerging products, is critical to support effective population-based interventions to prevent and reduce tobacco use among youths as part of comprehensive tobacco prevention and control programs.",

In this study, we compare the health and economic outcomes of the new test with existing syphilis tests/testing algorithms in a high prevalence setting. METHODS: We used a cohort decision analysis model to examine 4 testing/screening algorithms; the Dual-POC test, the laboratory-based rapid plasma reagin and Treponema pallidum haemagglutination assay (RPR+TPHA) algorithm, an onsite RPR testing, and point-of-care treponemal immunochromatographic strip (ICS) testing. Outcomes included miscarriage, stillbirth, congenital syphilis, low birth weight, and neonatal death. Disability-adjusted life-years were estimated for all health outcomes. The analytic horizon was the life expectancy for the mother and child. RESULTS: For a cohort of 1000 pregnant women in a historically high syphilis prevalence population (10% infected and 15% previously infected), the model predicted a total of 39 adverse pregnancy outcomes if no serologic screening were performed; 13 for the laboratory-based RPR+TPHA; 11 for the on-site RPR strategy; 5 for the Dual-POC strategy; and 2 for the ICS strategy. On the basis of assumption that the cost of ICS and the Dual-POC tests were the same, the ICS strategy was the most cost saving (saved $30,000) followed by the Dual-POC strategy (saved $27,000). CONCLUSIONS: The dual-POC test may help save cost in resource-poor settings where disease prevalence (and loss to follow-up) is high, while substantially reducing overtreatment.",

        "abstract": "Since the late 1980s, the U.S. Department of Labor has considered regulating a systems approach to occupational health and safety management. Recently, a health and safety management systems (HSMS) standard has returned to the regulatory agenda of both the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA). Because a mandated standard has implications for both industry and regulating bodies alike, it is imperative to gain a greater understanding of the potential effects that an HSMS regulatory approach can have on establishment-level injuries and illnesses. Through the lens of MSHA's regulatory framework, we first explore how current enforcement activities align with HSMS elements. Using MSHA data for the years 2003-2010, we then analyze the relationship between various types of enforcement activities (e.g., total number of citations, total penalty amount, and HSMS-aligned citations) and mine reportable injuries. Our findings show that the reduction in mine reportable injuries predicted by increases in MSHA enforcement ranges from negligible to 18%. The results suggest that the type and focus of the enforcement activity may be more important for accident reduction than the total number of citations issued and the associated penalty amount.",

RESULTS: During 2005-2009, the 100 schools sampled reported a total of 118 heat illnesses among high school athletes resulting in >/=1day of time lost from athletic activity, a rate of 1.6 per 100,000 athlete-exposures, and an average of 29.5 time-loss heat illnesses per school year. The average corresponds to a weighted average annual estimate of 9,237 illnesses nationwide. The highest rate of time-loss heat illness was among football players, 4.5 per 100,000 athlete-exposures, a rate 10 times higher than the average rate (0.4) for the eight other sports. Time-loss heat illnesses occurred most frequently during August (66.3%) and while practicing or playing football (70.7%). No deaths were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with guidelines from the National Athletic Trainers' Association, to reduce the risk for heat illness, high school athletic programs should implement heat-acclimatization guidelines (e.g., set limits on summer practice duration and intensity). All athletes, coaches, athletic trainers, and parents/guardians should be aware of the risk factors for heat illness, follow recommended strategies, and be prepared to respond quickly to symptoms of illness. Coaches also should continue to stress to their athletes the importance of maintaining proper hydration before, during, and after sports activities. IMPACT OF INDUSTRY: By implementing preventive recommendations and quickly recognizing and responding to heat illness, coaches, athletic trainers, and the sporting community can prevent future deaths.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: During the 2004-2005 school year, the Mississippi Department of Education, Office of Child Nutrition, initiated a pilot program to distribute free fruit and vegetable snacks to students during the school day. This article describes the first-year implementation of the Mississippi Fruit and Vegetable Pilot Program. METHODS: The process evaluation addressed where, when, and how produce was distributed; what was distributed; challenges and successes; and recommended modifications. Five of the 25 program schools were selected to participate in the evaluation; selection was based on grade levels served and demographic characteristics. Data were collected from program staff (N = 11) and administrators (N = 6) via interviews and logs; student (N = 42) and parent (N = 19) focus groups; student questionnaires (N = 660); and school staff questionnaires (N = 207). RESULTS: Distributing fresh fruit and vegetable snacks at school was well received by staff and students. Most schools distributed the fresh fruit and vegetable snacks at morning break in classrooms or a central courtyard. Twenty-two types of fresh fruit, 4 types of dried fruit, and 7 types of vegetables were served to students during the program year. Commonly distributed fruit included apples, oranges, pears, bananas, and tangerines. Carrots were the staple vegetable, followed by celery. Key challenges included getting students to try new foods and receiving the produce in a timely manner without spoiling. Main successes included seeing students try new fruit and vegetable snacks, having the program run smoothly, and teacher support. CONCLUSIONS: The program fit well within the school structure and could be an effective component of a multifaceted approach to enhancing child nutrition.",

        "abstract": "CDC has updated its interim guidance for U.S. health care providers caring for women of reproductive age with possible Zika virus exposure (1) to include recommendations on counseling women and men with possible Zika virus exposure who are interested in conceiving. This guidance is based on limited available data on persistence of Zika virus RNA in blood and semen (2-5). Women who have Zika virus disease* should wait at least 8 weeks after symptom onset to attempt conception, and men with Zika virus disease should wait at least 6 months after symptom onset to attempt conception. Women and men with possible exposure to Zika virus but without clinical illness consistent with Zika virus disease should wait at least 8 weeks after exposure to attempt conception. Possible exposure to Zika virus is defined as travel to or residence in an area of active Zika virus transmission (http://www.cdc.gov/zika/geo/active-countries.html), or sex (vaginal intercourse, anal intercourse, or fellatio) without a condom with a man who traveled to or resided in an area of active transmission. Women and men who reside in areas of active Zika virus transmission should talk with their health care provider about attempting conception. This guidance also provides updated recommendations on testing of pregnant women with possible Zika virus exposure. These recommendations will be updated when additional data become available.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: During the first wave of pandemic H1N1 influenza in 2009, most cases outside North America occurred in the UK. The clinical characteristics of UK patients hospitalised with pandemic H1N1 infection and risk factors for severe outcome are described. METHODS: A case note-based investigation was performed of patients admitted with confirmed pandemic H1N1 infection. RESULTS: From 27 April to 30 September 2009, 631 cases from 55 hospitals were investigated. 13% were admitted to a high dependency or intensive care unit and 5% died; 36% were aged <16 years and 5% were aged > or = 65 years. Non-white and pregnant patients were over-represented. 45% of patients had at least one underlying condition, mainly asthma, and 13% received antiviral drugs before admission. Of 349 with documented chest x-rays on admission, 29% had evidence of pneumonia, but bacterial co-infection was uncommon. Multivariate analyses showed that physician-recorded obesity on admission and pulmonary conditions other than asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were associated with a severe outcome, as were radiologically-confirmed pneumonia and a raised C-reactive protein (CRP) level (> or = 100 mg/l). 59% of all in-hospital deaths occurred in previously healthy people. CONCLUSIONS: Pandemic H1N1 infection causes disease requiring hospitalisation of previously fit individuals as well as those with underlying conditions. An abnormal chest x-ray or a raised CRP level, especially in patients who are recorded as obese or who have pulmonary conditions other than asthma or COPD, indicate a potentially serious outcome. These findings support the use of pandemic vaccine in pregnant women, children <5 years of age and those with chronic lung disease.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: We assessed human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine uptake among adolescent girls, parents' intentions to vaccinate daughters, and barriers and facilitators of vaccination in a population at elevated risk for cervical cancer. METHODS: Between October 2007 and June 2008, telephone surveys were conducted with randomly selected parents/guardians of 11-18 year old girls attending public middle and high schools serving economically disadvantaged populations in Los Angeles County. RESULTS: We surveyed 509 predominantly Hispanic (81%) and African American (16%) parents; 71% responded in Spanish. Overall, 23% reported their daughter had received >/=1 dose of HPV vaccine. Although 93% of daughters had seen a doctor in the past year, only 30% reported that a provider recommended HPV vaccine. Characteristics positively associated with odds of having initiated HPV vaccine were having heard of the vaccine (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.6), belief in vaccine effectiveness (aOR 2.9), and doctor recommendation (aOR 48.5). Negative attitudes toward HPV vaccine (aOR 0.2) and needing more information about it (aOR 0.1) were negatively associated with vaccine initiation. Of those with unvaccinated daughters (n=387), 62% said they \"probably/definitely will\" vaccinate within the next year and 21% were undecided or didn't know; only 11% said they definitely won't. CONCLUSIONS: About one-quarter of adolescent girls in this at-risk community had initiated HPV vaccine by mid-2008. Provider recommendation was the single most important factor associated with vaccination. Because a substantial proportion of parents remain undecided about HPV vaccine, health care providers can play a key role by providing needed information and offering HPV vaccine to all eligible adolescents.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hyperglycaemia is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular complications in people with type 2 diabetes. We investigated whether reduction of blood glucose concentration decreases the rate of microvascular complications in people with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: ACCORD was a parallel-group, randomised trial done in 77 clinical sites in North America. People with diabetes, high HbA(1c) concentrations (>7.5%), and cardiovascular disease (or >/=2 cardiovascular risk factors) were randomly assigned by central randomisation to intensive (target haemoglobin A(1c) [HbA(1c)] of <6.0%) or standard (7.0-7.9%) glycaemic therapy. In this analysis, the prespecified composite outcomes were: dialysis or renal transplantation, high serum creatinine (>291.7 micromol/L), or retinal photocoagulation or vitrectomy (first composite outcome); or peripheral neuropathy plus the first composite outcome (second composite outcome). 13 prespecified secondary measures of kidney, eye, and peripheral nerve function were also assessed. Investigators and participants were aware of treatment group assignment. Analysis was done for all patients who were assessed for microvascular outcomes, on the basis of treatment assignment, irrespective of treatments received or compliance to therapies. ACCORD is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00000620. FINDINGS: 10,251 patients were randomly assigned, 5128 to the intensive glycaemia control group and 5123 to standard group. Intensive therapy was stopped before study end because of higher mortality in that group, and patients were transitioned to standard therapy. At transition, the first composite outcome was recorded in 443 of 5107 patients in the intensive group versus 444 of 5108 in the standard group (HR 1.00, 95% CI 0.88-1.14; p=1.00), and the second composite outcome was noted in 1591 of 5107 versus 1659 of 5108 (0.96, 0.89-1.02; p=0.19). Results were similar at study end (first composite outcome 556 of 5119 vs 586 of 5115 [HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.85-1.07, p=0.42]; and second 1956 of 5119 vs 2046 of 5115, respectively [0.95, 0.89-1.01, p=0.12]). Intensive therapy did not reduce the risk of advanced measures of microvascular outcomes, but delayed the onset of albuminuria and some measures of eye complications and neuropathy. Seven secondary measures at study end favoured intensive therapy (p<0.05). INTERPRETATION: Microvascular benefits of intensive therapy should be weighed against the increase in total and cardiovascular disease-related mortality, increased weight gain, and high risk for severe hypoglycaemia.

The aim of this study was to assess prevalence of HBV infection among antiretroviral-naive, HIV-infected pregnant women in Malawi and examine HBV transmission to their infants. METHODS: Plasma from 2048 HIV-infected, Malawian women and their infants were tested for markers of HBV infection. Study participants were provided standard-of-care health services, which included administration of pentavalent vaccine to infants at 6, 10, and 14weeks of age. RESULTS: One-hundred and three women (5%) were HBsAg-positive; 70 of these HBsAg-positive women were also HBV-DNA-positive. Sixteen women (0.8%) were HBV-DNA-positive but HBsAg-negative. Five of 51 infants (9.8%) born to HBsAg-positive and/or HBV-DNA-positive women were HBV-DNA-positive by 48weeks of age.HBV DNA concentrations of two infants of mothers who received extended lamivudine-containing anti-HIV prophylaxis were <4 log10 IU/ml compared to 8 log10 IU/ml in three infants of mothers who did not. CONCLUSIONS: HBV DNA was detected in nearly 10% of infants born to HBV/HIV-coinfected women. Antenatal testing for HIV and HBV, if instituted, can facilitate implementation of prophylactic measures against infant infection by both viruses.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Respondent-driven sampling (RDS) is a new data collection methodology used to estimate characteristics of hard-to-reach groups, such as the HIV prevalence in drug users. Many national public health systems and international organizations rely on RDS data. However, RDS reporting quality and available reporting guidelines are inadequate. We carried out a systematic review of RDS studies and present Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology for RDS Studies (STROBE-RDS), a checklist of essential items to present in RDS publications, justified by an explanation and elaboration document. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We searched the MEDLINE (1970-2013), EMBASE (1974-2013), and Global Health (1910-2013) databases to assess the number and geographical distribution of published RDS studies. STROBE-RDS was developed based on STROBE guidelines, following Guidance for Developers of Health Research Reporting Guidelines. RESULTS: RDS has been used in over 460 studies from 69 countries, including the USA (151 studies), China (70), and India (32). STROBE-RDS includes modifications to 12 of the 22 items on the STROBE checklist. The two key areas that required modification concerned the selection of participants and statistical analysis of the sample. CONCLUSION: STROBE-RDS seeks to enhance the transparency and utility of research using RDS. If widely adopted, STROBE-RDS should improve global infectious diseases public health decision making.",

        "abstract": "Following the detection of a novel influenza strain A(H7N9), we modeled the use of antiviral treatment in the United States to mitigate severe disease across a range of hypothetical pandemic scenarios. Our outcomes were total demand for antiviral (neuraminidase inhibitor) treatment and the number of hospitalizations and deaths averted. The model included estimates of attack rate, healthcare-seeking behavior, prescription rates, adherence, disease severity, and the potential effect of antivirals on the risks of hospitalization and death. Based on these inputs, the total antiviral regimens estimated to be available in the United States (as of April 2013) were sufficient to meet treatment needs for the scenarios considered. However, distribution logistics were not examined and should be addressed in future work. Treatment was estimated to avert many severe outcomes (5200-248 000 deaths; 4800-504 000 hospitalizations); however, large numbers remained (25 000-425 000 deaths; 580 000-3 700 000 hospitalizations), suggesting that the impact of combinations of interventions should be examined.",

Cumulative PCB exposure was estimated using plant-specific job-exposure matrices. External comparisons to US and state-specific populations used standardized mortality ratios, adjusted for gender, race, age and calendar year. Among long-term workers employed 3 months or longer, within-cohort comparisons used standardized rate ratios and multivariable Poisson regression modeling. Through 2008, more than one million person-years at risk and 8749 deaths were accrued. Among long-term employees, all-cause and all-cancer mortality were not elevated; of the a priori outcomes assessed only melanoma mortality was elevated. Mortality was elevated for some outcomes of a priori interest among subgroups of long-term workers: all cancer, intestinal cancer and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (women); melanoma (men); melanoma and brain and nervous system cancer (Indiana plant); and melanoma and multiple myeloma (New York plant). Standardized rates of stomach and uterine cancer and multiple myeloma mortality increased with estimated cumulative PCB exposure. Poisson regression modeling showed significant associations with estimated cumulative PCB exposure for prostate and stomach cancer mortality. For other outcomes of a priori interest - rectal, liver, ovarian, breast, and thyroid cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Alzheimer disease, and Parkinson disease - neither elevated mortality nor positive associations with PCB exposure were observed. Associations between estimated cumulative PCB exposure and stomach, uterine, and prostate cancer and myeloma mortality confirmed our previous positive findings.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: To improve clinical and public health outcomes through early human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) detection, fourth-generation antigen/antibody immunoassay (4IA) and supplemental testing results must be returned rapidly. METHODS: We examined HIV testing data at Harborview Medical Center (HMC), Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), and the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC), which used 4IA and supplemental antibody and nucleic acid tests (NATs). At MGH and MUSC, HIV-1 Western blot (WB) and HIV-2 testing were conducted at a reference laboratory. We compared time from specimen collection to laboratory result for established (positive WB) and acute infections (reactive 4IA, negative/indeterminate WB, detectable NAT), and we calculated testing cost per positive-test result. RESULTS: From 3731 (MUSC) to 19 774 (MGH) tests were conducted; 0.01% (MGH) to 0.05% (HMC) were acute infections. Each laboratory had reactive 4IA, WB-negative, or indeterminate specimens without NAT (ie, potential acute infections). Time to result was 1.5 (HMC) to 5.2 days (MGH) for acute and 1.0 (HMC) to 5.2 days (MGH) for established infections. Costs were $1054 (MGH) to $1521 (MUSC). CONCLUSIONS: Conducting supplemental testing in-house lowered turnaround times, which may be further reduced with rapid HIV-1/HIV-2 differentiation tests. Hospitals may benefit from quantitative NATs not requiring physician orders, so all potential acute infections receive NAT.",

Humans are the only species known to develop illness after CCHF virus (CCHFV) infection, characterized by a nonspecific febrile illness that can progress to severe, often fatal, hemorrhagic disease. A variety of animals may serve as asymptomatic reservoirs of CCHFV in an endemic cycle of transmission. Seroepidemiological studies have been instrumental in elucidating CCHFV reservoirs and in determining endemic foci of viral transmission. Herein, we review over 50 years of CCHFV seroepidemiological studies in domestic and wild animals. This review highlights the role of livestock in the maintenance and transmission of CCHFV, and provides a detailed summary of seroepidemiological studies of wild animal species, reflecting their relative roles in CCHFV ecology.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of mammography screening for women ages 40 to 49 years still is questioned, and few studies of the effectiveness of service screening for this age group have been conducted. METHODS: Breast cancer mortality was compared between women who were invited to service screening at ages 40 to 49 years (study group) and women in the same age group who were not invited during 1986 to 2005 (control group). Together, these women comprise the Mammography Screening of Young Women (SCRY) cohort, which includes all Swedish counties. A prescreening period was defined to facilitate a comparison of mortality in the absence of screening. The outcome measure was refined mortality, ie, breast cancer death for women who were diagnosed during follow-up at ages 40 to 49 years. Relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in breast cancer mortality during the prescreening period. During the study period, there were 803 breast cancer deaths in the study group (7.3 million person-years) and 1238 breast cancer deaths in the control group (8.8 million person-years). The average follow-up was 16 years. The estimated RR for women who were invited to screening was 0.74 (95% CI, 0.66-0.83), and the RR for women who attended screening was 0.71 (95% CI, 0.62-0.80).

CASE: A 34-year-old woman, gravida 4 para 3, at 36 weeks of gestation was admitted to an Ebola treatment unit in Sierra Leone with Ebola virus disease confirmed by laboratory testing of maternal blood for Ebola RNA. She complained of headache, cough, and arthralgia for 7 days but was afebrile. Eleven days later, intrauterine fetal death was diagnosed; the following day, maternal blood was negative for Ebola viral RNA. Labor was induced and resulted in the vaginal delivery of a stillborn fetus. The mother recovered. Her vaginal secretions (on the day of induction), a placenta fragment, umbilical cord, and neonatal buccal swabs were positive for Ebola RNA. No exposed health care workers were infected.

        "abstract": "Accumulations of dormant eggs in container habitats allow Aedes aegypti populations to survive harsh environmental conditions and may frustrate control interventions directed at larval and adult life stages. While sodium hypochlorite solutions (NaOCl) have long been recognized as ovicides for use against dengue vectors, the susceptibility of eggs to spray applications has not been robustly evaluated on substrate materials representative of the most frequently utilized artificial container habitats. Experiments were performed under controlled and natural conditions by applying dilutions of household bleach (52.5 ppt NaOCl) as a spray to eggs on plastic, rubber, and concrete surfaces, with and without a smectite clay thickener. Laboratory assays identified the minimum NaOCl concentrations required to eliminate eggs on plastic (10 ppt), rubber (20 ppt) and concrete (20 ppt) surfaces. Addition of smectite clay reduced the minimum effective concentration to 10 ppt NaOCl for all 3 substrates. A minimum exposure period of 24 h was required to completely eliminate egg viability on concrete surfaces, even at the highest NaOCl concentration (52.5 ppt). Field experiments verified that spray application of a 13 dilution of household bleach mixed with smectite clay can reduce egg hatching by >/= 99% in shaded and sun-exposed plastic containers. Similarly, 41 dilution of household bleach (with or without smectite clay) eliminated >/= 98% of eggs from concrete surfaces in outdoor, water-filled drums. In this study, we propose a practical, effective and safe strategy for using household bleach to eliminate Ae. aegypti eggs in a range of artificial container habitats.",

        "abstract": "Cryptococcal meningitis (CM) is one of the leading opportunistic infections associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The worldwide burden of CM among persons living with HIV/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) was estimated in 2009 to be 957,900 cases, with approximately 624,700 deaths annually. The high burden of CM globally comes despite the fact that cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) is detectable weeks before the onset of symptoms, allowing screening for cryptococcal infection and early treatment to prevent CM and CM-related mortality (2). However, few studies have been conducted in the United States to assess the prevalence of cryptococcal infection. To quantify the prevalence of undiagnosed cryptococcal infection in HIV-infected persons in the United States during 1986-2012, stored sera from 1,872 participants in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study and the Women's Interagency HIV Study with CD4 T-cell counts <100 cells/microL were screened for CrAg, using the CrAg Lateral Flow Assay (LFA) (Immy, Inc.). This report describes the results of that analysis, which indicated the overall prevalence of CrAg positivity in this population to be 2.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.2%-3.7%).",

        "abstract": "Rotavirus vaccine was introduced in El Salvador in 2006 and is recommended to be given concomitantly with DTP-HepB-Haemophilus influenzae type b (pentavalent) vaccine at ages 2 months (upper age limit 15 weeks) and 4 months (upper age limit 8 months) of age. However, rotavirus vaccination coverage continues to lag behind that of pentavalent vaccine, even in years when national rotavirus vaccine stock-outs have not occurred. We analyzed factors associated with receipt of oral rotavirus vaccine among children who received at least 2 doses of pentavalent vaccine in a stratified cluster survey of children aged 24-59 months conducted in El Salvador in 2011. Vaccine doses included were documented on vaccination cards (94.4%) or in health facility records (5.6%). Logistic regression and survival analysis were used to assess factors associated with vaccination status and age at vaccination. Receipt of pentavalent vaccine by age 15 weeks was associated with rotavirus vaccination (OR: 5.1; 95% CI 2.7, 9.4), and receipt of the second pentavalent dose by age 32 weeks was associated with receipt of two rotavirus vaccine doses (OR: 5.0; 95% CI 2.1-12.3). Timely coverage with the first pentavalent vaccine dose was 88.2% in the 2007 cohort and 91.1% in the 2008 cohort (p=0.04). Children born in 2009, when a four-month national rotavirus vaccine stock-out occurred, had an older median age of receipt of rotavirus vaccine and were less likely to receive rotavirus on the same date as the same dose of pentavalent vaccine than children born in 2007 and 2008. Upper age limit recommendations for rotavirus vaccine administration contributed to suboptimal vaccination coverage. Survey data suggest that late rotavirus vaccination and co-administration with later doses of pentavalent vaccine among children born in 2009 helped increase rotavirus vaccine coverage following shortages.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dengue is a potentially fatal acute febrile illness (AFI) caused by four mosquito-transmitted dengue viruses (DENV-1-4) that are endemic in Puerto Rico. In January 2010, the number of suspected dengue cases reported to the passive dengue surveillance system exceeded the epidemic threshold and an epidemic was declared soon after. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To characterize the epidemic, surveillance and laboratory diagnostic data were compiled. A suspected case was a dengue-like AFI in a person reported by a health care provider with or without a specimen submitted for diagnostic testing. Laboratory-positive cases had: (i) DENV nucleic acid detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in an acute serum specimen; (ii) anti-DENV IgM antibody detected by ELISA in any serum specimen; or (iii) DENV antigen or nucleic acid detected in an autopsy-tissue specimen. In 2010, a total of 26,766 suspected dengue cases (7.2 per 1,000 residents) were identified, of which 46.6% were laboratory-positive. Of 7,426 RT-PCR-positive specimens, DENV-1 (69.0%) and DENV-4 (23.6%) were detected more frequently than DENV-2 (7.3%) and DENV-3 (<0.1%). Nearly half (47.1%) of all laboratory-positive cases were adults, 49.7% had dengue with warning signs, 11.1% had severe dengue, and 40 died. Approximately 21% of cases were primary DENV infections, and 1-4 year olds were the only age group for which primary infection was more common than secondary. Individuals infected with DENV-1 were 4.2 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.7-9.8) and 4.0 (95% CI: 2.4-6.5) times more likely to have primary infection than those infected with DENV-2 or -4, respectively. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This epidemic was long in duration and yielded the highest incidence of reported dengue cases and deaths since surveillance began in Puerto Rico in the late 1960's. This epidemic re-emphasizes the need for more effective primary prevention interventions to reduce the morbidity and mortality of dengue.",

        "abstract": "We sequenced and annotated the genomes of four P. vivax strains collected from disparate geographic locations, tripling the number of genome sequences available for this understudied parasite and providing the first genome-wide perspective of global variability in this species. We observe approximately twice as much SNP diversity among these isolates as we do among a comparable collection of isolates of P. falciparum, a malaria-causing parasite that results in higher mortality. This indicates a distinct history of global colonization and/or a more stable demographic history for P. vivax relative to P. falciparum, which is thought to have undergone a recent population bottleneck. The SNP diversity, as well as additional microsatellite and gene family variability, suggests a capacity for greater functional variation in the global population of P. vivax. These findings warrant a deeper survey of variation in P. vivax to equip disease interventions targeting the distinctive biology of this neglected but major pathogen.",

        "abstract": "Fruits and vegetables are a major vehicle for transmission of foodborne enteric viruses since they are easily contaminated at pre- and post-harvest stages and they undergo little or no processing. However, commonly used sanitizers are relatively ineffective for removing human norovirus surrogates from fresh produce. In this study, we systematically evaluated the effectiveness of surfactants on sanitization of a human norovirus surrogate, murine norovirus 1 (MNV-1), from fresh produce. We showed that a panel of surfactants, including sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), Nonidet P-40 (NP-40), Triton X-100, and polysorbates, significantly enhanced the sanitization of viruses from fresh fruits and vegetables. While tap water alone and chlorine solution (200 ppm) only reduced less than 1.2 logs of virus in all fresh produce, 50 ppm of surfactant solution was able to achieve 3 logs of virus reduction in strawberry and approximately 2 logs of virus reduction in lettuce, cabbage and raspberry. Moreover, approximately 3 logs of virus reduction were observed in all the tested fresh produce after sanitization with a combination of 50 ppm of each surfactant and 200 ppm of chlorine solution. Taken together, our results demonstrated that the combination of a surfactant with a commonly used sanitizer enhanced the efficiency in removing viruses from fresh produce by approximately 100 times. Since SDS is an FDA approved food additive and polysorbates are FDA recognized GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe) products, implementation of this novel sanitization strategy would be a feasible approach to efficiently reduce the virus load in fresh produce.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis screening is recommended for people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection to facilitate early diagnosis and safe initiation of antiretroviral therapy and isoniazid preventive therapy. No internationally accepted, evidence-based guideline addresses the optimal means of conducting such screening, although screening for chronic cough is common. METHODS: We consecutively enrolled people with HIV infection from eight outpatient clinics in Cambodia, Thailand, and Vietnam. For each patient, three samples of sputum and one each of urine, stool, blood, and lymph-node aspirate (for patients with lymphadenopathy) were obtained for mycobacterial culture. We compared the characteristics of patients who received a diagnosis of tuberculosis (on the basis of having one or more specimens that were culture-positive) with those of patients who did not have tuberculosis to derive an algorithm for screening and diagnosis. RESULTS: Tuberculosis was diagnosed in 267 (15%) of 1748 patients (median CD4+ T-lymphocyte count, 242 per cubic millimeter; interquartile range, 82 to 396). The presence of a cough for 2 or 3 weeks or more during the preceding 4 weeks had a sensitivity of 22 to 33% for detecting tuberculosis. The presence of cough of any duration, fever of any duration, or night sweats lasting 3 or more weeks in the preceding 4 weeks was 93% sensitive and 36% specific for tuberculosis. In the 1199 patients with any of these symptoms, a combination of two negative sputum smears, a normal chest radiograph, and a CD4+ cell count of 350 or more per cubic millimeter helped to rule out a diagnosis of tuberculosis, whereas a positive diagnosis could be made only for the 113 patients (9%) with one or more positive sputum smears; mycobacterial culture was required for most other patients. CONCLUSIONS: In persons with HIV infection, screening for tuberculosis should include asking questions about a combination of symptoms rather than only about chronic cough. It is likely that antiretroviral therapy and isoniazid preventive therapy can be started safely in people whose screening for all three symptoms is negative, whereas diagnosis in most others will require mycobacterial culture.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Few methods have been defined for evaluating the individual and collective impacts of academic research centers. In this project, with input from injury center directors, we systematically defined indicators to assess the progress and contributions of individual Injury Control Research Centers (ICRCs) and, ultimately, to monitor progress of the overall injury center program. METHOD: We used several methods of deriving a list of recommended priority and supplemental indicators. This included published literature review, telephone interviews with selected federal agency staff, an e-mail survey of injury center directors, an e-mail survey of staff at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a two-stage Delphi process (e-mailed), and an in-person focus group with injury center directors. We derived the final indicators from an analysis of ratings of potential indicators by center directors and CDC staff. We also examined qualitative responses to open-ended items that address conceptual and implementation issues. RESULTS: All currently funded ICRCs participated in at least one part of the process, resulting in a list of 27 primary indicators (some with subcomponents), 31 supplemental indicators, and multiple suggestions for using the indicators. CONCLUSION: Our results support an approach that combines standardized definitions and quantifiable indicators with qualitative reporting, which allows consideration of center distinctions and priorities. The center directors urged caution in using the indicators, given funding constraints and recognition of unique institutional environments. While focused on injury research centers, we suggest these indicators also may be useful to academic research centers of other types.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Excessive alcohol consumption claims more than 75,000 lives in the United States each year. The prevalence of alcohol dependence among excessive drinkers is not well known. METHODS: Data from the 2002 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) in New Mexico were used to assess the prevalence of excessive drinking, including binge drinking, heavy drinking, alcohol-impaired driving, and alcohol dependence. RESULTS: Of 4,761 respondents, 16.5% were excessive drinkers; 14.4% binge drank and 1.8% were alcohol dependent. While the rates of alcohol dependence were higher among the youngest age group, males, those with some college education, and those of race/ethnicity other than White, non-Hispanic, only differences by age were statistically significant. The prevalence of alcohol dependence was the highest among those who reported alcohol-impaired driving in the past 30 days (15.9%), and was lower among those who reported heavy drinking (13.4%) and binge drinking (8.1%). CONCLUSIONS: Although 16.5% of New Mexico adults had at least 1 type of excessive drinking, only 1.8% of all adults met the criteria for alcohol dependence. Furthermore, only a minority of those who reported binge drinking, heavy drinking, or alcohol-impaired driving met the criteria for alcohol dependence. This suggests that most alcohol problems in New Mexico are likely due to excessive drinking among persons who are not alcohol dependent. The adverse health and social consequences associated with excessive drinking are not limited to those who are alcohol dependent, but extend to a broader range of problem drinkers across the population.",

        "abstract": "A single 2 g dose of azithromycin effectively treats genitourinary infections caused by susceptible Neisseria gonorrhoeae and has been used to treat uncomplicated gonorrhea in persons with cephalosporin allergy. However, azithromycin is not recommended as monotherapy because of concern over the emergence of resistance. Instead, a 1 g dose of azithromycin is recommended as a component of dual therapy for gonorrhea, in conjunction with a cephalosporin (i.e., 250 mg of ceftriaxone or 400 mg of cefixime, if ceftriaxone is not an option). During January 1992 -- July 2009, of 87,566 N. gonorrhoeae isolates tested for azithromycin susceptibility by CDC's national Gonoccoccal Isolate Surveillance Project (GISP), only 39 (0.04%) had minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) >/=8 mcg/mL (including 25 with 8 mcg/mL and 14 with 16 mcg/mL), indicating reduced susceptibility; none of the isolates were collected in San Diego County, California (CDC, unpublished data, 2011). During August-- October 2009, five of 55 (9.1%) N. gonorrhoeae isolates obtained from men with symptomatic urethritis tested at San Diego County's main municipal sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic had high azithromycin MICs: three with 8 mcg/mL and two with 16 mcg/mL. This report summarizes the laboratory and epidemiologic findings associated with this reduced susceptibility to azithromycin. In San Diego County, clinicians treating cephalosporin-allergic patients with a 2 g dose of azithromycin for uncomplicated gonorrhea are advised to obtain tests of cure 3 weeks after treatment and to recommend sexual abstinence until a negative test result for gonorrhea is achieved. Continued surveillance for antibiotic resistance and effective control efforts are critical for gonorrhea prevention.",

We assessed the association of sociodemographic (age, sex, race-ethnicity, education, and income) and lifestyle (smoking, alcohol consumption, BMI, physical activity, and dietary supplement use) variables with these biomarkers in U.S. adults (aged >/=20 y). We used bivariate and multiple regression models and assessed the magnitude of an estimated change in biomarker concentration with change in a covariable for 2 biomarkers of acrylamide exposure. Smoking was strongly and significantly correlated with HbAA and HbGA concentrations (rs = 0.51 and 0.42, respectively), with biomarker concentrations being 126 and 101% higher in smokers compared with nonsmokers after adjusting for sociodemographic and lifestyle covariates. Age was moderately and significantly correlated with both biomarkers (rs = -0.21 and -0.22, respectively). BMI (rs = -0.11) and alcohol consumption (rs = 0.13) were weakly yet significantly correlated with HbAA concentrations only. The estimated percentage change in biomarker concentration was </=20% for all variables other than smoking after adjusting for sociodemographic and lifestyle covariates. Using multiple regression models, the sociodemographic variables explained 9 and 7% whereas the sociodemographic and lifestyle variables together explained 46 and 25% of the variability in HbAA and HbGA, respectively, showing the importance of considering and adequately controlling for these variables in future studies. Our findings will be useful in the design and analysis of future studies that assess and evaluate exposure to acrylamide and its metabolism to glycidamide.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To examine the global prevalence and major risk factors for diabetic retinopathy (DR) and vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy (VTDR) among people with diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A pooled analysis using individual participant data from population-based studies around the world was performed. A systematic literature review was conducted to identify all population-based studies in general populations or individuals with diabetes who had ascertained DR from retinal photographs. Studies provided data for DR end points, including any DR, proliferative DR, diabetic macular edema, and VTDR, and also major systemic risk factors. Pooled prevalence estimates were directly age-standardized to the 2010 World Diabetes Population aged 20-79 years. RESULTS: A total of 35 studies (1980-2008) provided data from 22,896 individuals with diabetes. The overall prevalence was 34.6% (95% CI 34.5-34.8) for any DR, 6.96% (6.87-7.04) for proliferative DR, 6.81% (6.74-6.89) for diabetic macular edema, and 10.2% (10.1-10.3) for VTDR. All DR prevalence end points increased with diabetes duration, hemoglobin A(1c), and blood pressure levels and were higher in people with type 1 compared with type 2 diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: There are approximately 93 million people with DR, 17 million with proliferative DR, 21 million with diabetic macular edema, and 28 million with VTDR worldwide. Longer diabetes duration and poorer glycemic and blood pressure control are strongly associated with DR. These data highlight the substantial worldwide public health burden of DR and the importance of modifiable risk factors in its occurrence. This study is limited by data pooled from studies at different time points, with different methodologies and population characteristics.",

        "abstract": "Since its identification in April 2009, an A(H1N1) virus containing a unique combination of gene segments from both North American and Eurasian swine lineages has continued to circulate in humans. The lack of similarity between the 2009 A(H1N1) virus and its nearest relatives indicates that its gene segments have been circulating undetected for an extended period. Its low genetic diversity suggests that the introduction into humans was a single event or multiple events of similar viruses. Molecular markers predictive of adaptation to humans are not currently present in 2009 A(H1N1) viruses, suggesting that previously unrecognized molecular determinants could be responsible for the transmission among humans. Antigenically the viruses are homogeneous and similar to North American swine A(H1N1) viruses but distinct from seasonal human A(H1N1).",

        "abstract": "The hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) glycoprotein is utilized by human parainfluenza viruses for binding to the host cell. By the use of glycan array assays, we demonstrate that, in addition to the first catalytic-binding site, the HN of human parainfluenza virus type 1 has a second site for binding covered by N-linked glycan. Our data suggest that attachment of the first site to sialic acid (SA)-linked receptors triggers exposure of the second site. We found that both sites bind to alpha2-3-linked SAs with a preference for a sialyl-Lewis(x) motif. Binding to alpha2-3-linked SAs with a sulfated sialyl-Lewis motif as well as to alpha2-8-linked SAs was unique for the second binding site. Neither site recognizes alpha2-6-linked oligosaccharides.",

        "abstract": "Chlamydia psittaci (C. psittaci) is an obligate intracellular zoonotic pathogen that can be transmitted to humans from birds. No efficacious commercial vaccine is available for clearing chlamydial infection due to lack of potential vaccine candidates and effective delivery vehicles. Herpesvirus of turkeys (HVT) is an efficacious commercially available vaccine against Marek's Disease virus (MDV). In this study, a recombinant HVT-delivered vaccine against C. psittaci and Marek's disease was developed and examined. The 5'-terminus of pmpD gene (pmpD-N) encoding the N-terminal fragment of polymorphic membrane protein D of C. psittaci was inserted into a nonessential region of HVT genome using reverse genetics based on an infectious bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone of HVT. The recombinant virus (rHVT-pmpD-N) was recovered from primary chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF) cells by transfection of modified HVT BAC DNA containing the pmpD-N gene. The rHVT-pmpD-N construct was confirmed to express PmpD-N by immunoblot and immunofluorescence. The rHVT-pmpD-N was stable during 20 passages in vitro. The growth kinetics of rHVT-pmpD-N was comparable to that of parental HVT in vitro and in vivo. One-day-old SPF chickens inoculated subcutaneously with rHVT-pmpD-N displayed increased PmpD-specific antibody levels and a vigorous PmpD-specific lymphocyte proliferation response using HVT vector or CEF cells as control. Furthermore, the percentage of CD4+ cells was significantly elevated in rHVT-pmpD-N-immunized birds as compared to the parental HVT. All chickens vaccinated with rHVT-pmpD-N or parental HVT were protected completely against challenge with a very virulent strain of Marek's Disease virus (MDV) RB-1B. Post challenge with C. psittaci CB7 strain, a significant decrease in respiratory distress, lesions and Chlamydia load was found in the rHVT-pmpD-N-vaccinated group compared to the parental HVT. In conclusion, our study suggests that the rHVT-pmpD-N live vaccine may be viable as a candidate dual vaccine that provides protection against both very virulent MDV and C. psittaci.",

        "abstract": "As part of a cluster-randomized trial to evaluate insecticide-treated curtains for dengue prevention in Iquitos, Peru, we surveyed 1,333 study participants to examine knowledge and reported practices associated with dengue and its prevention. Entomological data from 1,133 of these households were linked to the survey. Most participants knew that dengue was transmitted by mosquito bite (85.6%), but only few (18.6%) knew that dengue vectors bite during daytime. Most commonly recognized dengue symptoms were fever (86.6%), headache (76.4%), and muscle/joint pain (67.9%). Most commonly reported correct practices for mosquito control were cleaning homes (61.6%), using insecticide sprays (23%), and avoiding having standing water at home (12.3%). Higher education was associated with higher knowledge about dengue, including transmission and vector control. Higher socioeconomic status was associated with increased reported use of preventive practices requiring money expenditure. We were less likely to find Aedes aegypti eggs, larvae, or pupae in households that had < 5-year-old children at home. Although dengue has been transmitted in Iquitos since the 1990s and the Regional Health Authority routinely fumigates households, treats domestic water containers with larvicide, and issues health education messages through mass media, knowledge of dengue transmission and household practices for prevention could be improved.",

The map is based on standardized field sampling in 304 sites of the density of Ixodes scapularis host-seeking nymphs infected with B. burgdorferi, which is closely associated with human infection risk. Risk factors for the presence and density of infected nymphs were used to model a continuous 8 km x 8 km resolution predictive surface of human risk, including confidence intervals for each pixel. Discontinuous Lyme disease risk foci were identified in the Northeast and upper Midwest, with a transitional zone including sites with uninfected I. scapularis populations. Given frequent under- and over-diagnoses of Lyme disease, this map could act as a tool to guide surveillance, control, and prevention efforts and act as a baseline for studies tracking the spread of infection.",

        "abstract": "There is increasing interest in the use of tiered approaches in risk assessment of mixtures or co-exposures to chemicals for prioritization. One possible screening-level risk assessment approach is the threshold of toxicological concern (TTC). To date, default assumptions of dose or response additivity have been used to characterize the toxicity of chemical mixtures. Before a screening-level approach could be used, it is essential to know whether synergistic interactions can occur at low, environmentally relevant exposure levels. Studies demonstrating synergism in mammalian test systems were identified from the literature, with emphasis on studies performed at doses close to the points of departure (PODs) for individual chemicals. This search identified 90 studies on mixtures. Few included quantitative estimates of low-dose synergy; calculations of the magnitude of interaction were included in only 11 papers. Quantitative methodology varied across studies in terms of the null hypothesis, response measured, POD used to test for synergy, and consideration of the slope of the dose-response curve. It was concluded that consistent approaches should be applied for quantification of synergy, including that synergy be defined in terms of departure from dose additivity; uniform procedures be developed for assessing synergy at low exposures; and the method for determining the POD for calculating synergy be standardized. After evaluation of the six studies that provided useful quantitative estimates of synergy, the magnitude of synergy at low doses did not exceed the levels predicted by additive models by more than a factor of 4.",

National Q fever seroprevalence was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and confirmed by using immunofluorescent antibody testing. Overall seroprevalence for Coxiella burnetii was 3.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.1-4.3%) among 4,437 adults > or = 20 years of age. Coxiella burnetii age-adjusted antibody prevalence was higher for men than for women (3.8%, 95% CI = 2.7-5.2% versus 2.5%, 95% CI = 1.5-3.7%, respectively, P < 0.05). Mexican Americans had a significantly higher antibody prevalence (7.4%, 95% CI = 6.6-8.3%) than either non-Hispanic whites (2.8%, 95% CI = 1.7-4.3%) or non-Hispanic blacks (1.3%, 95% CI = 0.6-2.5%) (P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that the risk for Q fever antibody positivity increased with age and was higher among persons who were foreign-born, male, and living in poverty. These findings indicate that the national seroprevalence of Q fever in the United States is higher than expected on the basis of case numbers reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from state health departments. Potential differences in risk for exposure by race/ethnicity warrant further study.",

        "abstract": "The Lyme disease spirochaete, Borrelia burgdorferi, causes damage to diverse host tissues and induces inflammation but the mechanisms of injury are poorly understood. We recently reported that a surface-exposed B. burgdorferi protease, which is expressed during human disease and is conserved within the major Lyme disease spirochaete species, degrades the extracellular matrix proteoglycan, aggrecan. Here we demonstrate that BbHtrA also degrades fibronectin and numerous proteoglycans found in skin, joints and neural tissues. BbHtrA degradation of fibronectin released known pro-inflammatory fibronectin fragments FnIII13-14 and Fnf-29, which may amplify the inflammatory processes triggered by the presence of the bacteria. When this hypothesis was tested directly by exposing chondrocytes to BbHtrA in vitro, inflammatory cytokines (sICAM-1 and IL-6) and chemokines (CXCL1, CCL1, CCL2 and CCL5) that are hallmarks of Lyme disease were induced. These results provide the first evidence that, by utilizing BbHtrA, B. burgdorferi may actively participate in its dissemination and in the tissue damage and inflammation observed in Lyme disease.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: We conducted an intervention to improve the implementation of a high school condom availability program, and evaluated its effect on students' awareness of the program and acquisition of condoms. METHODS: Twelve public high schools in the Los Angeles, CA area participated, half each in the intervention and control conditions. Project staff facilitated intervention schools' self-assessment of compliance with the school district's condom availability policy, creating an action plan by determining which mandatory program elements were lacking and identifying steps to improve compliance. Staff provided technical assistance and follow-up to assist schools in improving program implementation. From 2005 to 2009 (T1-T5), 29,823 students were randomly selected by classroom and they completed surveys. We tested for changes in students' awareness and acquisition of condoms over time between conditions using mixed model logistic regression analyses. Records of condom orders by schools also were reviewed. RESULTS: Awareness increased significantly among intervention versus control participants from T1 to T3 (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 1.28; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01, 1.62), T4 (AOR: 2.17; 95% CI: 1.70, 2.76), and T5 (AOR: 2.78; 95% CI: 2.18, 3.56). Acquisition of condoms increased significantly among intervention versus control participants from T1 to T4 (AOR: 1.69; 95% CI: 1.23, 2.32) and T5 (AOR: 1.81; 95% CI: 1.32, 2.49). Results were similar across gender and different levels of sexual experience. Orders of condoms increased markedly in intervention schools by T5. CONCLUSIONS: Feasible minor enhancements to condom availability program implementation improved program delivery, resulting in increased student awareness of the program and acquisition of condoms.",

        "abstract": "CONTEXT: There is a concerning prevalence of depression and suicidal ideation among medical students, a group that may experience poor mental health care due to stigmatization. OBJECTIVE: To characterize the perceptions of depressed and nondepressed medical students regarding stigma associated with depression. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional Web-based survey conducted in September-November 2009 among all students enrolled at the University of Michigan Medical School (N = 769). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of self-reported moderate to severe depression and suicidal ideation and the association of stigma perceptions with clinical and demographic variables. RESULTS: Survey response rate was 65.7% (505 of 769). Prevalence of moderate to severe depression was 14.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 11.3%-17.3%). Women were more likely than men to have moderate to severe depression (18.0% vs 9.0%; 95% CI for difference, -14.8% to -3.1%; P = .001). Third- and fourth-year students were more likely than first- and second-year students to report suicidal ideation (7.9% vs 1.4%; 95% CI for difference, 2.7%-10.3%; P = .001). Students with moderate to severe depression, compared with no to minimal depression, more frequently agreed that \"if I were depressed, fellow medical students would respect my opinions less\" (56.0% vs 23.7%; 95% CI for difference, 17.3%-47.3%; P < .001), and that faculty members would view them as being unable to handle their responsibilities (83.1% vs 55.1%; 95% CI for difference, 16.1%-39.8%; P < .001). Men agreed more commonly than women that depressed students could endanger patients (36.3% vs 20.1%; 95% CI for difference, 6.1%-26.3%; P = .002). First- and second-year students more frequently agreed than third- and fourth-year students that seeking help for depression would make them feel less intelligent (34.1% vs 22.9%; 95% CI for difference, 2.3%-20.1%; P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: Depressed medical students more frequently endorsed several depression stigma attitudes than nondepressed students. Stigma perceptions also differed by sex and class year.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Healthcare workers are thought to play a role in nosocomial transmission of norovirus, but the level and direction of norovirus transmission between patients and healthcare workers in sustaining transmission during an outbreak have not been quantified. METHODS: We developed a method for finding plausible transmission trees of who acquired their infection from whom. We applied the method to data from an outbreak of norovirus in 4 wards of a psychiatric institution in the Netherlands in 2008. The simulated transmission trees were based on serial intervals for time between symptom onsets, weighted for the number of days that healthcare workers were present. The obtained transmission trees were linked to the Barthel Index, a measure of patient reliance on healthcare in their basic daily activities. RESULTS: The dominant recognized transmission route was from patient to patient (64%), followed by patient to healthcare worker (29%). The overall estimated reproduction number for healthcare workers was low compared with patients (0.25 vs. 1.20; mean difference = 0.95 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.60 to 1.30]). The average number of all subsequent cases attributable to the downstream branch of one single infected healthcare worker in the transmission tree was 4.4 compared with 6.5 for cases attributable to one single infected patient (mean difference = 2.1 [95% CI = -4.7 to 8.9]). In the ward with patients requiring the highest level of care from healthcare workers, the attack rate among healthcare workers was highest. CONCLUSION: This approach provides a framework to quantify the magnitude and direction of transmission between healthcare workers and patients during a norovirus outbreak. The utility of this method in outbreaks of other infections and in different settings should be explored.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Rotavirus is the leading cause of severe diarrhea among children worldwide, killing approximately 600,000 children annually, including 64,800 in the Eastern Mediterranean Region. Safe, effective rotavirus vaccines will be available soon, and accurate disease burden data will be needed to assess the burden of rotavirus and the value of new vaccines and monitor vaccine program impact. METHODS: To identify epidemiologic studies in which rotavirus diagnostics were applied to children with acute gastroenteritis, we performed a systematic literature review. We selected studies that met 4 criteria and extracted rotavirus data on prevalence estimates, strain identification, age distribution of patients, and seasonal trends. RESULTS: Of the 63 published studies with some rotavirus detection data, 29 met inclusion criteria. Among patients with diarrhea, rotavirus was detected in 40% of inpatients and 23% of outpatients. By 3 years of age, 75% of children experienced a documented rotavirus infection. Circulation of rotavirus occurred year-round, and no clear relationship between the timing of the rotavirus peak with either season or latitude was observed. Comparison of country-specific rotavirus detection rates indicated that the proportion of hospitalizations for rotavirus infection increased with income. CONCLUSION: This systematic review of studies of rotavirus diarrhea among children in the countries of the Eastern Mediterranean Region documents that rotavirus is one of the most significant causes of childhood diarrhea in the region. The findings of this review will be used to establish sentinel hospital surveillance in these countries, estimate disease burden, and characterize its epidemiology using common protocols and diagnostics.",

        "abstract": "Hypertension is an important and modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease and mortality. Over the last decade, national-levels of controlled hypertension have increased, but little information on hypertension prevalence and trends in hypertension treatment and control exists at the county-level. We estimate trends in prevalence, awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension in US counties using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) in five two-year waves from 1999-2008 including 26,349 adults aged 30 years and older and from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) from 1997-2009 including 1,283,722 adults aged 30 years and older. Hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure (BP) of at least 140 mm Hg, self-reported use of antihypertensive treatment, or both. Hypertension control was defined as systolic BP less than 140 mm Hg. The median prevalence of total hypertension in 2009 was estimated at 37.6% (range: 26.5 to 54.4%) in men and 40.1% (range: 28.5 to 57.9%) in women. Within-state differences in the county prevalence of uncontrolled hypertension were as high as 7.8 percentage points in 2009. Awareness, treatment, and control was highest in the southeastern US, and increased between 2001 and 2009 on average. The median county-level control in men was 57.7% (range: 43.4 to 65.9%) and in women was 57.1% (range: 43.0 to 65.46%) in 2009, with highest rates in white men and black women. While control of hypertension is on the rise, prevalence of total hypertension continues to increase in the US. Concurrent increases in treatment and control of hypertension are promising, but efforts to decrease the prevalence of hypertension are needed.",

        "abstract": "In the cytoplasm, the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) senses the RNA genomes of several RNA viruses. RIG-I binds to viral RNA, eliciting an antiviral response via the cellular adaptor MAVS. Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), a negative sense RNA virus with a 5' -monophosphorylated genome, is a highly pathogenic zoonotic agent with significant public health and clinical implications. We found that, during CCHFV infection, RIG-I mediated a type-I interferon (IFN) response via MAVS. Interfering with RIG-I signaling reduced IFN production and IFN-stimulated gene expression, and increased viral replication. Immunostimulatory RNA was isolated from CCHFV-infected cells and from virion preparations, and RIG-I co-immunoprecipitation of infected cell lysates isolated immunostimulatory CCHFV RNA. This report serves as the first description of a pattern recognition receptor for CCHFV and highlights a critical signaling pathway in the antiviral response to CCHFV. IMPORTANCE: Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is a tick-borne virus with significant public health and clinical impact. In order for cells to respond to virus infection, they must recognize the virus as foreign and initiate antiviral signaling. To date, the receptors involved in recognition of CCHFV are not known. Herein we investigate and identify retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) as a receptor involved in initiating an antiviral response to CCHFV. This receptor was initially not expected to play a role in CCHFV recognition because of characteristics of the viral genome. These findings are important in understanding the antiviral response to CCHFV and support continued investigation into the spectrum of potential viruses recognized by RIG-I.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although seasonal variation in tuberculosis incidence has been described in several recent studies, the mechanism underlying this seasonality remains unknown. Seasonality of tuberculosis disease may indicate the presence of season-specific risk factors that could potentially be controlled if they were better understood. We conducted this study to determine whether tuberculosis is seasonal in the United States and to describe patterns of seasonality in specific populations. METHODS: We performed a time series decomposition analysis of tuberculosis cases reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 1993 through 2008. Seasonal amplitude of tuberculosis disease (the difference between the months with the highest and lowest mean case counts), was calculated for the population as a whole and for populations with select demographic, clinical, and epidemiologic characteristics. RESULTS: A total of 243,432 laboratory-confirmed tuberculosis cases were reported over a period of 16 years. A mean of 21.4% more cases were diagnosed in March, the peak month, compared with November, the trough month. The magnitude of seasonality did not vary with latitude. The greatest seasonal amplitude was found among children aged <5 years and in cases associated with disease clusters. CONCLUSIONS: Tuberculosis is a seasonal disease in the United States, with a peak in spring and trough in late fall. The latitude independence of seasonality suggests that reduced winter sunlight exposure may not be a strong contributor to tuberculosis risk. Increased seasonality among young children and clustered cases suggests that disease that is the result of recent transmission is more influenced by season than disease resulting from activation of latent infection.",

        "abstract": "Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne alphavirus that causes explosive outbreaks of febrile illness associated with rash, and painful arthralgia. The CHIK vaccine strain 181/clone25 (181/25) developed by the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) was shown to be well-tolerated and highly immunogenic in phase I and II clinical trials although it induced transient arthralgia in some healthy adult volunteers. In an attempt to better understand the host factors that are involved in the attenuating phenotype of CHIK 181/25 vaccine virus we conducted studies in interferon (IFN)-compromised mice and also evaluated its immunogenic potential and protective capacity. Infection of AG129 mice (defective in IFN-alpha/beta and IFN-gamma receptor signaling) with CHIK 181/25 resulted in rapid mortality within 3-4 days. In contrast, all infected A129 mice (defective in IFN-alpha/beta receptor signaling) survived with temporary morbidity characterized by ruffled appearance and body weight loss. A129 heterozygote mice that retain partial IFN-alpha/beta receptor signaling activity remained healthy. Infection of A129 mice with CHIK 181/25 induced significant levels of IFN-gamma and IL-12 while the inflammatory cytokines, TNFalpha and IL-6 remained low. A single administration of the CHIK 181/25 vaccine provided both short-term and long-term protection (38 days and 247 days post-prime, respectively) against challenge with wt CHIKV-La Reunion (CHIKV-LR). This protection was at least partially mediated by antibodies since passively transferred immune serum protected both A129 and AG129 mice from wt CHIKV-LR and 181/25 virus challenge. Overall, these data highlight the importance of IFNs in controlling CHIK 181/25 vaccine and demonstrate the ability of this vaccine to elicit neutralizing antibody responses that confer short-and long-term protection against wt CHIKV-LR challenge.",

        "abstract": "Autistic disorder (AD) is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder typically identified in early childhood. Both genetic and environmental factors are implicated in its etiology. The number of individuals identified as having autism has increased dramatically in recent years, but whether some proportion of this increase is real is unknown. If real, susceptible populations may have exposure to controllable exogenous stressors. Using literature AD data from long-term ( approximately 10-year) studies, we determined cumulative incidence of AD for each cohort within each study. These data for each study were examined for a changepoint year in which the AD cumulative incidence first increased. We used data sets from Denmark, California, Japan, and a worldwide composite of studies. In the Danish, California, and worldwide data sets, we found that an increase in AD cumulative incidence began about 1988-1989. The Japanese study (1988-1996) had AD cumulative incidence increasing continuously, and no changepoint year could be calculated. Although the debate about the nature of increasing autism continues, the potential for this increase to be real and involve exogenous environmental stressors exists. The timing of an increase in autism incidence may help in screening for potential candidate environmental stressors.",

Because important strides have been made in tobacco control, in terms of both interventions (tax hikes and laws creating smoke-free workplaces) and outcomes (smoking prevalence that has more than halved since the early 1960s, it is tempting to believe that the battle is largely won and that we should move on to other pressing public health issues. But the prevalence of smoking in the United States hovers at 20%, more than 8 million people are sick or disabled as a result of tobacco use, and smoking kills 450,000 Americans annually. If no additional progress is made in reducing smoking-initiation rates and increasing cessation rates, the prevalence of smoking in the United States will decline only to 16.7% by 2020 and will stabilize at 13.5% shortly after midcentury, and millions of people will die prematurely. We need to understand the epidemiology of smoking, look at the current state of tobacco control, and determine what more can be done; then we need to do it.",

Numerous health authorities have identified policy interventions as promising strategies for creating population-wide improvements in physical activity.

Policy-relevant evidence for promoting physical activity in youth may take numerous forms, including epidemiologic data and other supporting evidence (e.g., qualitative data). The implementation and evaluation of school PE interventions leads to a set of lessons related to epidemiology and evidence-based policy.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Birth defects are the leading cause of infant mortality and are responsible for substantial child and adult morbidity. Documenting the variation in prevalence of birth defects among racial/ethnic subpopulations is critical for assessing possible variations in diagnosis, case ascertainment, or risk factors among such groups. METHODS: We used data from the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program, a population-based birth defects registry with active case ascertainment. We estimated the racial/ethnic variation in prevalence of 46 selected major birth defects among live births, stillbirths, and pregnancy terminations at >20 weeks gestation among mothers residing in the five central counties of metropolitan Atlanta between 1994 and 2005, adjusting for infant sex, maternal age, gravidity, and socioeconomic status (SES). We also explored SES as a potential effect measure modifier. RESULTS: Compared with births to non-Hispanic white women, births to non-Hispanic black women had a significantly higher prevalence of five birth defects and a significantly lower prevalence of 10 birth defects, while births to Hispanic women had a significantly higher prevalence of four birth defects and a significantly lower prevalence of six birth defects. The racial/ethnic disparities in the prevalence of some defects varied by SES, but no clear pattern emerged. CONCLUSIONS: Racial/ethnic disparities were suggested in 57% of included birth defects. Disparities in the prevalence of birth defects may result from different underlying genetic susceptibilities; exposure to risk factors; or variability in case diagnosis, ascertainment, or reporting among the subpopulations examined. Policies that improve early diagnosis of birth defects could reduce associated morbidity and mortality.",

        "abstract": "Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) does not replicate in primary cells of New World primates. To better understand this restriction, we expressed owl monkey (Aotus nancymaae) CD4 and CXCR4 in the owl monkey kidney cell line, OMK. An HIV-1 variant modified to evade the owl monkey restriction factor TRIM-cyp replicated efficiently in these cells but could not replicate in primary A. nancymaae CD4-positive T cells. To understand this difference, we examined APOBEC3G and tetherin orthologs from OMK cells and primary A. nancymaae cells. We observed that OMK cells expressed substantially lower levels of APOBEC3G than did A. nancymaae cells. A. nancymaae, but not marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), APOBEC3G was partially downregulated by HIV-1 vif and reduced but did not abolish HIV-1 replication when stably expressed in OMK cells. The functional difference between A. nancymaae and marmoset APOBEC3Gs mapped to residue 128, previously shown to distinguish African green monkey from human APOBEC3G. We also characterized tetherin orthologs from OMK and A. nancymaae cells. The A. nancymaae tetherin ortholog, but not OMK tetherin, prevented HIV-1 release. Alteration of threonine 181 of OMK tetherin rescued its function and its efficient N glycosylation. All alleles of Aotus lemurinus griseimembra examined, but none of A. nancymaae or Aotus vociferans, encoded this nonfunctional tetherin ortholog. Our data indicate that HIV-1 replication in owl monkeys is not restricted at entry but can be limited by APOBEC3G and tetherin. Further, A. lemurinus griseimembra does not restrict HIV-1 replication via tetherin, a property likely useful for the study of tetherin-restricted viruses.",

Sixty-five scientists and public health officials from five countries attended the workshop and gave 36 presentations. During the workshop, many considerations were raised, gaps identified, and recommendations given for emergency radiobioassay for both preparedness and response in case of a radiological or nuclear incident. In short, some bioassay methods and protocols need to be developed, validated, and exercised; national and international radiobioassay laboratory networks should be established; and communications and collaborations among public health officials, monitoring experts, and medical staff are encouraged.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To describe the level of functionality of President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR)-supported HIV clinical services following the devastating earthquake that struck Haiti in January 2010. DESIGN: Available program-monitoring data from sites providing voluntary counseling and testing for HIV (VCT), antenatal care (ANC) and prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) services, and antiretroviral treatment (ART) were described, comparing pre-earthquake and post-earthquake periods during October 2008 to May 2010. METHODS: Pre-earthquake HIV service baselines for VCT, PMTCT, and ART enrollment were defined as monthly mean total number of patients served over 15 months pre-earthquake. ART baseline was defined as total current patients by December 2009. Sites were categorized as high-earthquake or low-earthquake intensity based on location and instrumental shake intensity data. RESULTS: Pre-earthquake mean monthly baselines were 41,087 (VCT), 11,909 (HIV testing at ANC sites), 648 (ART enrollment), and 296 (PMTCT enrollment); baseline total current patients on ART was 24,863. Service provision in January and May 2010, reported as percentage of baseline, was 43 and 78.7% (VCT), 50.8 and 88.7% (HIV testing at ANC), 46 and 81% (PMTCT), and 41 and 82.7% (ART enrollment), respectively. Current patients on ART decreased to 97% of baseline in April, rising to 103.9% by May; the initial decline was restricted to high-earthquake intensity areas. CONCLUSION: Following the Haiti earthquake, there was a transient, marked decline in VCT and new ART patient enrollment, whereas follow-up of established ART patients remained impressively high. HIV treatment continuity should be reinforced in disaster preparedness and response strategies in HIV epidemic settings.",

This study seeks to examine the link between disability and IPV in a nationally representative sample of U.S. women and men. Also, by establishing that disability preceded recent IPV victimization, this study allows for a more thorough understanding of whether people with disabilities are at greater risk of victimization subsequent to having a disability. METHODS: Data were analyzed from the 2010 National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey, an ongoing, national random digit dial telephone survey of U.S. adults. Estimates of age-adjusted 12-month IPV prevalence by disability status were calculated. RESULTS: Compared to women without a disability, women with a disability were significantly more likely to report experiencing each form of IPV measured, which includes rape, sexual violence other than rape, physical violence, stalking, psychological aggression, and control of reproductive or sexual health. For men, significant associations were found with respect to stalking and psychological aggression by an intimate partner. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that people with a disability are at greater risk of victimization and that primary and secondary prevention efforts might be targeted to those with a disability.",

        "abstract": "Mathematical models that estimate the proportion of foodborne illnesses attributable to food commodities at specific points in the food chain may be useful to risk managers and policy makers to formulate public health goals, prioritize interventions, and document the effectiveness of mitigations aimed at reducing illness. Using human surveillance data on laboratory-confirmed Salmonella infections from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Salmonella testing data from U.S. Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service's regulatory programs, we developed a point-of-processing foodborne illness attribution model by adapting the Hald Salmonella Bayesian source attribution model. Key model outputs include estimates of the relative proportions of domestically acquired sporadic human Salmonella infections resulting from contamination of raw meat, poultry, and egg products processed in the United States from 1998 through 2003. The current model estimates the relative contribution of chicken (48%), ground beef (28%), turkey (17%), egg products (6%), intact beef (1%), and pork (<1%) across 109 Salmonella serotypes found in food commodities at point of processing. While interpretation of the attribution estimates is constrained by data inputs, the adapted model shows promise and may serve as a basis for a common approach to attribution of human salmonellosis and food safety decision-making in more than one country.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To determine the past-year medical misuse prevalence for 4 controlled medication classes (pain, stimulant, sleeping, and antianxiety) among adolescents, and to assess substance use outcomes among adolescents who report medical misuse. DESIGN: A Web-based survey was self-administered by 2744 secondary school students in 2009-2010. SETTING: Two southeastern Michigan school districts. PARTICIPANTS: The sample had a mean age of 14.8 years and was 51.1% female. The racial/ethnic distribution was 65.0% white, 29.5% African American, 3.7% Asian, 1.3% Hispanic, and 0.5% other. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Past-year medical use and misuse of 4 controlled medication classes. RESULTS: Eighteen percent of the sample reported past-year medical use of at least 1 prescribed controlled medication. Among past-year medical users, 22.0% reported misuse of their controlled medications, including taking too much, intentionally getting high, or using to increase alcohol or other drug effects. Medical misusers were more likely than nonmisusers to divert their controlled medications and to abuse other substances. The odds of a positive screening result for drug abuse were substantially higher among medical misusers (adjusted odds ratio, 7.8; 95% confidence interval, 4.3-14.2) compared with medical users who used their controlled medications appropriately. The odds of drug abuse did not differ between medical users who used their controlled medications appropriately and nonusers. CONCLUSIONS: Most adolescents who used controlled medications took their medications appropriately. Substance use and diversion of controlled medications were more prevalent among adolescents who misused their controlled medications. Careful therapeutic monitoring could reduce medical misuse and diversion of controlled medications among adolescents.",

Overall, drowning death rates in the United States have declined in the last decade; however, drowning is the leading cause of injury death among children aged 1-4 years. In 2001, approximately 3,300 persons died from unintentional drowning in recreational water settings, and an estimated 5,600 were treated in emergency departments (EDs). To update information on the incidence and characteristics of fatal and nonfatal unintentional drowning in the United States, CDC analyzed death certificate data from the National Vital Statistics System and injury data from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System - All Injury Program (NEISS-AIP) for 2005-2009. The results indicated that each year an average of 3,880 persons were victims of fatal drowning and an estimated 5,789 persons were treated in U.S. hospital EDs for nonfatal drowning. Death rates and nonfatal injury rates were highest among children aged </=4 years; these children most commonly drowned in swimming pools. The drowning death rate among males (2.07 per 100,000 population) was approximately four times that for females (0.54). To prevent drowning, all parents and children should learn survival swimming skills. In addition, 1) environmental protections (e.g., isolation pool fences and lifeguards) should be in place; 2) alcohol use should be avoided while swimming, boating, water skiing, or supervising children; 3) lifejackets should be used by all boaters and weaker swimmers; and 4) all caregivers and supervisors should have training in cardiopulmonary resuscitation.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Since 2003, the Chinese National Health and Family Planning Commission (formerly the Ministry of Health) has implemented changes to more effectively communicate risk during public health emergencies. In spite of ongoing improvements, provincial and sub-provincial leaders face barriers, such as established modes of operation, lack of training, shortage of trained risk communicators, and limited understanding and willingness of recipients to mitigate risks. METHODS: We assessed the current status of and barriers to risk communication knowledge and practice among public health practitioners in China. We designed the survey questionnaire to capture information related to the risk communication core capacities required by international health regulations and common risk communication principles. RESULTS: Our findings showed that risk communication training has successfully developed an awareness of risk communication principles and the ability to implement those principles in practice in China. CONCLUSIONS: Future efforts should focus on areas such as a dedicated risk communication workforce, requirements that public health agencies develop a risk communication plan, and additional training for public health practitioners and their partners.

        "abstract": "Minimally invasive approaches to detect/predict target organ toxicity have significant practical applications in occupational toxicology. The potential application of peripheral blood transcriptomics as a practical approach to study the mechanisms of silica-induced pulmonary toxicity was investigated. Rats were exposed by inhalation to crystalline silica (15 mg/m(3), 6 h/day, 5 days) and pulmonary toxicity and global gene expression profiles of lungs and peripheral blood were determined at 32 weeks following termination of exposure. A significant elevation in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid lactate dehydrogenase activity and moderate histological changes in the lungs, including type II pneumocyte hyperplasia and fibrosis, indicated pulmonary toxicity in the rats. Similarly, significant infiltration of neutrophils and elevated monocyte chemotactic protein-1 levels in the lungs showed pulmonary inflammation in the rats. Microarray analysis of global gene expression profiles identified significant differential expression [>1.5-fold change and false discovery rate (FDR) p < 0.01] of 520 and 537 genes, respectively, in the lungs and blood of the exposed rats. Bioinformatics analysis of the differentially expressed genes demonstrated significant similarity in the biological processes, molecular networks, and canonical pathways enriched by silica exposure in the lungs and blood of the rats. Several genes involved in functions relevant to silica-induced pulmonary toxicity such as inflammation, respiratory diseases, cancer, cellular movement, fibrosis, etc, were found significantly differentially expressed in the lungs and blood of the silica-exposed rats. The results of this study suggested the potential application of peripheral blood gene expression profiling as a toxicologically relevant and minimally invasive surrogate approach to study the mechanisms underlying silica-induced pulmonary toxicity.",

The ability to develop and prioritize policy measures is hindered by important gaps in health economics data. METHODS AND RESULTS: The Policy Research Implementation Group (PRIG) of the National Forum for Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention convened a symposium to develop priorities for research on the economics of CVD primary prevention and elimination of CVD disparities. Suggested top opportunities include expanded CVD surveillance, advances in evaluation and economic modeling of primary prevention, and use of behavioral economics to identify new prevention strategies. Enhanced policy, funding, and leadership support are vital to realizing this research agenda. CONCLUSIONS: Targeted research on the health and economic value of CVD prevention, especially to eliminate CVD disparities, would bolster the justification for increased investment in cardiovascular health. 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd. on behalf of World Heart Federation.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: We reported previously that while prolonged tenofovir monotherapy of macaques infected with virulent simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) resulted invariably in the emergence of viral mutants with reduced in vitro drug susceptibility and a K65R mutation in reverse transcriptase, some animals controlled virus replication for years. Transient CD8+ cell depletion or short-term tenofovir interruption within 1 to 5 years of treatment demonstrated that a combination of CD8+ cell-mediated immune responses and continued tenofovir therapy was required for sustained suppression of viremia. We report here follow-up data on 5 such animals that received tenofovir for 8 to 14 years. RESULTS: Although one animal had a gradual increase in viremia from 3 years onwards, the other 4 tenofovir-treated animals maintained undetectable viremia with occasional viral blips (</= 300 RNA copies/ml plasma). When tenofovir was withdrawn after 8 to 10 years from three animals with undetectable viremia, the pattern of occasional episodes of low viremia (</= 3600 RNA/ml plasma) continued throughout the 10-month follow-up period. These animals had low virus levels in lymphoid tissues, and evidence of multiple SIV-specific immune responses. CONCLUSION: Under certain conditions (i.e., prolonged antiviral therapy initiated early after infection; viral mutants with reduced drug susceptibility) a virus-host balance characterized by strong immunologic control of virus replication can be achieved. Although further research is needed to translate these findings into clinical applications, these observations provide hope for a functional cure of HIV infection via immunotherapeutic strategies that boost antiviral immunity and reduce the need for continuous antiretroviral therapy.",

        "abstract": "Designing cluster randomized trials in clinical studies often requires accurate estimates of intraclass correlation, which quantifies the strength of correlation between units, such as participants, within a cluster, such as a practice. Published ICC estimates, even when available, often suffer from the problem of wide confidence intervals. Using data from a national, randomized, controlled study concerning violence prevention for children--the Safety Check--we compare the ICC values derived from two approaches only baseline data and using both baseline and follow-up data. Using a variance component decomposition approach, the latter method allows flexibility in handling complex data sets. For example, it allows for shifts in the outcome variable over time and for an unbalanced cluster design. Furthermore, we evaluate the large-sample formula for ICC estimates and standard errors using the bootstrap method. Our findings suggest that ICC estimates range from 0.012 to 0.11 for providers within practice and range from 0.018 to 0.11 for families within provider. The estimates derived from the baseline-only and repeated-measurements approaches agree quite well except in cases in which variation over repeated measurements is large. The reductions in the widths of ICC confidence limits from using repeated measurement over baseline only are, respectively, 62% and 42% at the practice and provider levels. The contribution of this paper therefore includes two elements, which are a methodology for improving the accuracy of ICC, and the reporting of such quantities for pediatric and other researchers who are interested in designing clustered randomized trials similar to the current study.",

STUDY DESIGN: An estimated 56,494,634 deliveries were identified from the 1995 through 2008 Nationwide Inpatient Sample. The association of primary and secondary chronic hypertension with adverse fetal and maternal outcomes was evaluated using regression modeling and adjusted population-attributable fractions were calculated. RESULTS: During the study period, the prevalence of primary and secondary hypertension increased from 0.90% in 1995 through 1996 to 1.52% in 2007 through 2008 (P for trend < .001) and from 0.07% to 0.24% (P for trend < .001), respectively. The population-attributable fraction for chronic hypertension was considerable for many maternal adverse outcomes, including acute renal failure (21%), pulmonary edema (14%), preeclampsia (11%), and in-hospital mortality (10%). CONCLUSION: Primary and secondary chronic hypertension were both strongly associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes and accounted for a substantial fraction of maternal morbidity.

In Guatemala, two of the four historical endemic foci have demonstrated elimination of transmission, following World Health Organization guidelines. Using established guidelines ophthalmological, serological, and entomological evaluations were conducted in 2007-8 to determine the transmission status of onchocerciasis in the Huehuetenango focus. The prevalence of Onchocerca volvulus microfilariae in the anterior segment of the eye in 365 residents was 0% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0-0.8%), the prevalence of infection of O. volvulus in Simulium ochraceum among 8252 flies collected between November 2007 and April 2008 was 0% (95% CI 0-0.02%), and the prevalence of antibodies to a recombinant O. volvulus antigen in 3118 school age children was 0% (95% CI 0-0.1%). These results showed transmission interruption; thus, in 2009 mass treatment was halted and posttreatment surveillance began. To verify for potential recrudescence an entomological evaluation (from December 2010 to April 2011) was conducted during the 2nd and 3rd year of posttreatment surveillance. A total of 4587 S. ochraceum were collected, and the prevalence of infection of O. volvulus was 0% (95% CI 0-0.04%). Transmission of onchocerciasis in the Huehuetenango focus has been eliminated.",

Assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of this evidence, and hence the ability to synthesize it, has been limited by inadequate reporting of results. The STrengthening the REporting of Genetic Association studies (STREGA) initiative builds on the STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) Statement and provides additions to 12 of the 22 items on the STROBE checklist. The additions concern population stratification, genotyping errors, modelling haplotype variation, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, replication, selection of participants, rationale for choice of genes and variants, treatment effects in studying quantitative traits, statistical methods, relatedness, reporting of descriptive and outcome data, and the volume of data issues that are important to consider in genetic association studies. The STREGA recommendations do not prescribe or dictate how a genetic association study should be designed but seek to enhance the transparency of its reporting, regardless of choices made during design, conduct, or analysis.",

The SOE initiated an investigation; investigators interviewed employees, offered blood lead screening to employees and their families, and observed a visit to the industrial facility by the Alaska Occupational Safety and Health Section (AKOSH). Among the 15 employees with known work responsibilities, 12 had an elevated BLL at least once from October 2010 through February 2011. Of these 12 employees, 10 reported working in the fire assay room. Four children of employees had BLLs >/=5 microg/dL. Employees working in Facility A's fire assay room were likely exposed to lead at work and could have brought lead home. AKOSH inspectors reported that they could not share their consultative report with SOE investigators because of the confidentiality requirements of a federal regulation, which hampered Alaska SOE investigators from fully characterizing the lead exposure standards.",

The objective of this study was to characterise the vibration transmissibility spectra and frequency-weighted vibration transmissibility of VR gloves at the palm of the hand in three orthogonal directions. Seven adult males participated in the evaluation of seven glove models using a three-dimensional hand-arm vibration test system. Three levels of hand coupling force were applied in the experiment. This study found that, in general, VR gloves are most effective at reducing vibrations transmitted to the palm along the forearm direction. Gloves that are found to be superior at reducing vibrations in the forearm direction may not be more effective in the other directions when compared with other VR gloves. This casts doubts on the validity of the standardised glove screening test. Practitioner Summary: This study used human subjects to measure three-dimensional vibration transmissibility of vibration-reducing gloves at the palm and identified their vibration attenuation characteristics. This study found the gloves to be most effective at reducing vibrations along the forearm direction. These gloves did not effectively attenuate vibration along the handle axial direction.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections are often defined as health care (HA) or community-associated (CA) using common classification schemes involving health care risk factor, infection type, susceptibility pattern, or molecular typing. This investigation compared pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) molecular typing results (dichotomized as HA or CA) with our new MRSA infection classification method. The goal was to develop an improved predictive model for PFGE-type based primarily on the other 3 classification variables. METHODS: Methicillin-resistant S. aureus infections reported to the Michigan Department of Community Health from October 2004 to December 2005 were analyzed. Patients' demographics, risk factors, infection information, and susceptibility results were collected for 2151 cases. A subset of 244 MRSA infections with available PFGE results was analyzed. Results of logistic regression are presented using a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. RESULTS: The multivariable models predicted the PFGE classification as HA or CA (Max-rescaled R = 61%) better than health care risk factor, infection type, or susceptibility pattern alone (max-rescaled R = 21%, 34%, and 46%, respectively). The best model included infection type, susceptibility pattern, age, and hospitalized during infection. CONCLUSIONS: This model provides a simpler, more accurate prediction of HA or CA status, thus enhancing efforts to control MRSA infections. (Copyright 2011 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.)",

        "abstract": "A growing body of evidence has found that mortality rates are positively correlated with social inequalities, air pollution, elevated ambient temperature, availability of medical care and other factors. This study develops a model to predict the mortality rates for different diseases by county across the US. The model is applied to predict changes in mortality caused by changing environmental factors. A total of 3,110 counties in the US, excluding Alaska and Hawaii, were studied. A subset of 519 counties from the 3,110 counties was chosen by using systematic random sampling and these samples were used to validate the model. Step-wise and linear regression analyses were used to estimate the ability of environmental pollutants, socio-economic factors and other factors to explain variations in county-specific mortality rates for cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), all causes combined and lifespan across five population density groups. The estimated models fit adequately for all mortality outcomes for all population density groups and, adequately predicted risks for the 519 validation counties. This study suggests that, at local county levels, average ozone (0.07 ppm) is the most important environmental predictor of mortality. The analysis also illustrates the complex inter-relationships of multiple factors that influence mortality and lifespan, and suggests the need for a better understanding of the pathways through which these factors, mortality, and lifespan are related at the community level.",

To update data on aviation-related wildland firefighting fatalities, identify risk factors, and make recommendations for improved safety, CDC's National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) analyzed reports from multiple data sources for the period 2000-2013. Among 298 wildland firefighter fatalities identified during 2000-2013, 78 (26.2%) were aviation-related occupational fatalities that occurred during 41 separate events involving 42 aircraft. Aircraft crashes accounted for 38 events. Pilots, copilots, and flight engineers represented 53 (68%) of the aviation-related fatalities. The leading causes of fatal aircraft crashes were engine, structure, or component failure (24%); pilot loss of control (24%); failure to maintain clearance from terrain, water, or objects (20%); and hazardous weather (15%). To reduce fatalities from aviation-related wildland firefighting activities, stringent safety guidelines need to be followed during all phases of firefighting, including training exercises. Crew resource management techniques, which use all available resources, information, equipment, and personnel to achieve safe and efficient flight operations, can be applied to firefighting operations.",

Animals were exposed rectally to escalating virus doses weekly for up to 28 weeks. PrEP significantly delayed infection with SHIV(K65R) (p=0.028) although 4/6 FTC/TDF-treated macaques were infected at the end of the challenges. These findings highlight the need to closely monitor PrEP efficacy in areas with prevalent K65R.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: The nested case control study design, in which a fixed number of controls are matched to each case, is often used to analyze exposure response associations within a cohort. It has become common practice to sample four or five controls per case; however, previous research has shown that in certain instances, significant gains in relative efficiency can be realized when more controls are matched to each case. This study expanded upon this and investigated the effect of (i) the number of cases, (ii) the strength of the exposure response, and (iii) the skewness of the exposure distribution on the bias and relative efficiency of the conditional likelihood estimator from a nested case Control study. METHODS: Cohorts were simulated and analyzed using conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: The relative efficiency decreased and bias away from the null increased, as the true exposure response parameter increased and the skewness of the exposure distribution of the risk-sets increased. This became more pronounced when the number of cases in the cohort was small. CONCLUSIONS: Gains in relative efficiency and a reduction in bias can be realized by sampling more than four or five controls per case generally used, especially when there are few cases, a strong exposure response relation, and a skewed exposure variable.",

Clinical grading for ocular disease is currently used for evaluating trachoma elimination programs, but serological surveillance can be a sensitive measure of disease transmission and provide a more objective testing strategy than clinical grading. We calculated the basic reproduction number from serological data in settings with high, medium, and low disease transmission based on clinical disease. The data showed a striking relationship between age seroprevalence and clinical data, demonstrating the proof-of-principle that age seroprevalence predicts transmission rates and therefore could be used as an indicator of decreased transmission of ocular trachoma.",

        "abstract": "During the last decade there has been a remarkable and unexplained increase in the prevalence of asthma. These studies were conducted to investigate the role of dermal exposure to triclosan, an endocrine-disrupting compound, on the hypersensitivity response to ovalbumin (OVA) in a murine model of asthma. Triclosan has had widespread use in the general population as an antibacterial and antifungal agent and is commonly found in consumer products such as soaps, deodorants, toothpastes, shaving creams, mouth washes, and cleaning supplies. For these studies, BALB/c mice were exposed dermally to concentrations of triclosan ranging from 0.75-3% (0.375-1.5 mg/mouse/day) for 28 consecutive days. Concordantly, mice were intraperitoneally injected with OVA (0.9 mcg) and aluminum hydroxide (0.5 mg) on days 1 and 10 and challenged with OVA (125 mcg) by pharyngeal aspiration on days 19 and 27. Compared to the animals exposed to OVA alone, increased spleen weights, OVA-specific IgE, Interleukin (IL)-13 cytokine levels, and lung eosinophils were demonstrated when mice were co-exposed to OVA and triclosan. Statistically significant increases in OVA-specific and non-specific airway hyperreactivity (AHR) were observed for all triclosan co-exposed groups when compared to the vehicle and OVA controls. In these studies exposure to triclosan alone was not demonstrated to be allergenic, however; co-exposure with a known allergen resulted in enhancement of the hypersensitivity response to that allergen, suggesting that triclosan exposure may augment the allergic responses to other environmental allergens.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Information on influenza virology and epidemiology from Lao PDR is limited and the seasonal patterns of influenza have not been previously described. OBJECTIVES: To describe epidemiological and virologic characteristics of influenza in Lao PDR to recommend public health interventions, including improvements in surveillance and response. PATIENTS/METHODS: We performed a descriptive analysis of samples taken from patients with influenza-like-illness (ILI) (fever >38 degrees C with cough and/or sore throat) presenting at seven sentinel hospitals in three regions of Lao PDR, January 2008-December 2010. A nasopharyngeal (NP) swab or combined nasal with oropharyngeal swab was collected from patients with ILI. Samples were tested for influenza by either Luminex RVP, conventional reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) (January 2008-2009), or by real-time PCR (rRT-PCR) using US CDC reagents (February 2009 onward). RESULTS: Of 2346 samples tested from patients with ILI, 523 (22%) were positive for influenza. The median age of those positive was 12 years (range, <1-60 year). The percentage of samples that were influenza positive was similar over the 3 years (20-23%). Each year 3-4 types/subtypes cocirculated with differing predominant type/subtype. Influenza was detected year-round with the highest proportion of positive specimens in the 3rd and 4th quarter. CONCLUSIONS: Similar to other countries in the region, we found that influenza is present year-round and has a peak activity from July to December. Dominant types or subtypes vary by year. A large proportion of patients with ILI are not influenza positive. ILI surveillance is critical for weighing disease burden, both morbidity and mortality, against the costs of advancing influenza vaccine delivery strategy.",

        "abstract": "The relative contribution of four influenza virus exposure pathways-(1) virus-contaminated hand contact with facial membranes, (2) inhalation of respirable cough particles, (3) inhalation of inspirable cough particles, and (4) spray of cough droplets onto facial membranes-must be quantified to determine the potential efficacy of nonpharmaceutical interventions of transmission. We used a mathematical model to estimate the relative contributions of the four pathways to infection risk in the context of a person attending a bed-ridden family member ill with influenza. Considering the uncertainties in the sparse human subject influenza dose-response data, we assumed alternative ratios of 3,200:1 and 1:1 for the infectivity of inhaled respirable virus to intranasally instilled virus. For the 3,200:1 ratio, pathways (1), (2), and (4) contribute substantially to influenza risk: at a virus saliva concentration of 10(6) mL(-1), pathways (1), (2), (3), and (4) contribute, respectively, 31%, 17%, 0.52%, and 52% of the infection risk. With increasing virus concentrations, pathway (2) increases in importance, while pathway (4) decreases in importance. In contrast, for the 1:1 infectivity ratio, pathway (1) is the most important overall: at a virus saliva concentration of 10(6) mL(-1), pathways (1), (2), (3), and (4) contribute, respectively, 93%, 0.037%, 3.3%, and 3.7% of the infection risk. With increasing virus concentrations, pathway (3) increases in importance, while pathway (4) decreases in importance. Given the sparse knowledge concerning influenza dose and infectivity via different exposure pathways, nonpharmaceutical interventions for influenza should simultaneously address potential exposure via hand contact to the face, inhalation, and droplet spray.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The prevalence of chronic kidney disease as measured by biomarkers is increasing, but the recognition for this condition remains low in the USA. Little is known about the awareness of kidney disease at the state level. METHODS: Data from 490,302 adults aged 18 years or older in all 50 states as well as the District of Columbia who participated in the 2011 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System were analyzed. Kidney disease diagnosis, a measure of individual awareness, was ascertained by participants' self-report in the telephone survey. Prevalence ratios of self-reported kidney disease in subpopulations were estimated and tested using log-linear regression analyses with a robust variance estimator. RESULTS: The unadjusted prevalence of self-reported kidney disease was estimated to be 2.5%. After adjustment for age and all other selected covariates, Hispanics had a higher prevalence than non-Hispanic whites (adjusted prevalence ratio 1.2, 95% CI 1.0-1.4). Persons who were unemployed (adjusted prevalence ratio 1.4, 95% CI 1.2-1.5) had a higher prevalence than those who were employed. Persons who had hypertension (adjusted prevalence ratio 1.9, 95% CI 1.7-2.1), diabetes (adjusted prevalence ratio 1.7, 95% CI 1.5-1.8), cardiovascular disease (coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction or stroke; adjusted prevalence ratio 1.5, 95% CI 1.4-1.6) or cancer (adjusted prevalence ratio 1.5, 95% CI 1.3-1.6) had a higher prevalence of self-reported kidney disease than those without these conditions. CONCLUSION: The overall awareness of kidney disease was low in the general population. Efforts are needed to promote the awareness and early detection of kidney disease in public health services and clinical practice.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Using the Global Adult Tobacco Surveys from 14 primarily low- and middle-income countries, we describe the association between the probability of being a recent quitter and a number of demographic and policy-relevant factors such as exposure to warning labels, work-site smoking bans, antismoking media messaging, tobacco marketing, and current cigarette and bidi prices. METHODS: Logistic regressions were used to examine the potential correlates of recent quitting and recent quit attempts. RESULTS: After accounting for country-specific attributes in pooled analyses, we found that higher rates of exposure to work-site smoking bans are associated with higher odds of being a quitter (odds ratio [OR] with 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.13 [1.04, 1.22]). Exposure to antismoking media messaging (OR with 95% CI = 1.08 [1.00, 1.17]), work-site smoking bans (OR with 95% CI = 1.11 [0.99, 1.26]), and warning labels (OR with 95% CI = 1.03 [1.01, 1.05]); cigarette prices (OR with 95% CI = 1.01 [1.00, 1.02]), and bidi prices (OR with 95% CI =1.17 [1.11, 1.22]) are factors associated with higher odds of recent quit attempts in the pooled analysis. These effects vary by country. Exposure to warning labels is found to be associated with greater likelihood of recent quitting in Egypt (OR with 95% CI = 3.20 [1.53, 6.68]), and the positive association between exposure to work-site smoking bans and quitting is particularly strong for Southeast Asia (OR with 95% CI = 1.20 [1.06, 1.35]) and Asia Pacific countries (OR with 95% CI = 1.85 [0.93, 3.68]). Additionally, exposure to tobacco industry marketing is significantly associated with smaller odds of quitting in Asia Pacific (OR with 95% CI = 0.83 [0.79, 0.87]) and Latin American countries (OR with 95% CI = 0.78 [0.74, 0.82]). CONCLUSIONS: Although our results vary by country, they generally suggest that greater exposure to tobacco control polices is significantly associated with quitting.",

        "abstract": "During 2012, four north-central Texas counties experienced high West Nile virus (WNV) disease incidence. Aerial insecticide spraying was conducted in two counties. To evaluate the effect of spraying on WNV disease, we calculated incidence rate ratios (IRRs) in treated and untreated areas by comparing incidence before and after spraying; for unsprayed areas, before and after periods were defined by using dates from a corresponding sprayed area. In treated areas, WNV neuroinvasive disease incidence before and after spraying was 7.31/100,000 persons and 0.28/100,000 persons, respectively; the IRR was 26.42 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 12.42-56.20). In untreated areas, the before and after incidence was 4.80/100,000 persons and 0.45/100,000 persons, respectively; the IRR was 10.57 (95% CI: 6.11-18.28). The ratio of IRRs was 2.50 (95% CI: 0.98-6.35). Disease incidence decreased in both areas, but the relative change was greater in aerial-sprayed areas.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study examined the effect of abacavir on acute changes in biomarkers associated with cardiovascular dysfunction. METHODS: Among the Study to Understand the Natural History of HIV/AIDS in the Era of Effective therapy (SUN) participants, we identified 25 individuals (cases) who were HLA-B5701-negative and who had >/=2 weeks without abacavir exposure at one visit and >/=2 weeks with abacavir exposure at the consecutive visit while maintaining viral suppression. We identified 43 individuals (controls) similarly unexposed and exposed to tenofovir. We assessed concentrations of prothrombin fragment F(1+2), D-dimer, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, interleukin-8, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, vascular adhesion molecule-1, E-selectin, P-selectin, serum amyloid A and serum amyloid P. We examined the median percentage change of these biomarkers from the unexposed to exposed state among cases and controls compared with the expected assay variability using a sign test, and compared changes among cases with controls using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were similar between cases and controls: median age 45 versus 46 years, 80% versus 81% male, 64% versus 63% non-Hispanic White and median CD4(+) T-cell count 538 versus 601 cells/mm(3), respectively. Mean exposure times were 65 and 15 weeks for abacavir and tenofovir, respectively. We observed no significant changes in biomarkers from the unexposed to exposed state among cases or controls compared with the expected assay variability. We found that no biomarkers were significantly increased among cases compared with controls; however, prothrombin fragment F(1+2) was significantly lower among controls (P=0.035). CONCLUSIONS: In virologically suppressed contemporary HIV-infected patients, abacavir exposure was not associated with increases in biomarkers associated with increased cardiovascular risk.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of a parent-based intervention to prevent sexual risk behavior among Latino and African American young adults. This was delivered to mothers while waiting for their adolescent child to complete an annual physical examination. METHODS: A randomized clinical trial was conducted with 264 mother-adolescent dyads in New York City. Adolescents were eligible for the study only if they were African American or Latino and aged 11-14 years, inclusive. Dyads completed a brief baseline survey and were then randomly assigned to one of the following two conditions: (1) a parent-based intervention (n = 133), or (2) a \"standard care\" control condition (n = 131). Parents and adolescents completed a follow-up survey nine months later. The primary outcomes included whether the adolescent had ever engaged in vaginal sexual intercourse, the frequency of sexual intercourse, and the frequency of oral sex. RESULTS: Relative to the control group, statistically significant reduced rates of transitioning to sexual activity and frequency of sexual intercourse were observed, with oral sex reductions nearly reaching statistical significance (p < .054). Specifically, sexual activity increased from 6% to 22% for young adults in the \"standard of care\" control condition, although it remained at 6% among young adults in the intervention condition at the 9-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: A parent-based intervention delivered to mothers in a pediatric clinic as they waited for their child to complete a physical examination may be an effective way to reduce sexual risk behaviors among Latino and African American middle-school young adults.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Physicians dismissing families who refuse vaccines from their practices is controversial. We assessed the following among pediatricians (Peds) and family physicians (FPs): (1) reported prevalence of parental refusal of 1 or more vaccines in the infant series; (2) physician response to refusal; and (3) the association between often/always dismissing families and provider/practice characteristics and state exemption laws. METHODS: Nationally representative survey conducted June to October 2012. A multivariable analysis assessed association of often/always dismissing families with physician/practice characteristics, state philosophical exemption policy, and degree of difficulty obtaining nonmedical exemptions. RESULTS: The response rate was 66% (534/815). Overall, 83% of physicians reported that in a typical month, >/=1% of parents refused 1 or more infant vaccines, and 20% reported that >5% of parents refused. Fifty-one percent reported always/often requiring parents to sign a form if they refused (Peds 64%, FP 29%, P < .0001); 21% of Peds and 4% of FPs reported always/often dismissing families if they refused >/=1 vaccine. Peds only were further analyzed because few FPs dismissed families. Peds who dismissed families were more likely to be in private practice (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 4.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.40-17.19), from the South (aOR 4.07, 95% CI 1.08-15.31), and reside in a state without a philosophical exemption law (aOR 3.70, 95% CI 1.74-7.85). CONCLUSIONS: Almost all physicians encounter parents who refuse infant vaccines. One-fifth of Peds report dismissing families who refuse, but there is substantial variation in this practice. Given the frequency of dismissal, the impact of this practice on vaccine refusers and on pediatric practices should be studied.",

        "abstract": "A series of experiments were conducted to quantify and characterize the optical and physical properties of combustion-generated aerosols during both flaming and smoldering combustion of three materials common to underground mines - Pittsburgh Seam coal, Styrene Butadiene Rubber (a common mine conveyor belt material), and Douglas-fir wood - using a combination of analytical and gravimetric measurements. Laser photometers were utilized in the experiments for continuous measurement of aerosol mass concentrations and for comparison to measurements made using gravimetric filter samples. The aerosols of interest lie in the size range of tens to a few hundred nanometers, out of range of the standard photometer calibration. To correct for these uncertainties, the photometer mass concentrations were compared to gravimetric samples to determine if consistent correlations existed. The response of a calibrated and modified combination ionization/photoelectric smoke detector was also used. In addition, the responses of this sensor and a similar, prototype ionization/photoelectric sensor, along with discrete angular scattering, total scattering, and total extinction measurements, were used to define in real time the size, morphology, and radiative transfer properties of these differing aerosols that are generally in the form of fractal aggregates. SEM/TEM images were also obtained in order to compare qualitatively the real-time, continuous experimental measurements with the visual microscopic measurements. These data clearly show that significant differences exist between aerosols from flaming and from smoldering combustion and that these differences produce very different scattering and absorption signatures. The data also indicate that ionization/photoelectric sensors can be utilized to measure continuously and in real time aerosol properties over a broad spectrum of applications related to adverse environmental and health effects.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Exposure to London Plane Tree (Platanus) bioaerosols in Sydney, Australia has been anecdotally linked to respiratory irritation, rhinitis, and conjunctivitis. OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationships between Platanus bioaerosol exposure, allergic sensitization, and symptoms. METHODS: Sixty-four subjects with self-reported Platanus symptoms were recruited from inner-urban Sydney. Allergic sensitization was determined by skin prick test (SPT) to 13 allergens. Airborne concentrations of Platanus pollen, trichomes, and achene fibers, and other pollen and fungal spores, were measured over the spring and summer of 2006-2007. Subjects' allergic symptoms were monitored concurrently. The Halogen immunoassay (HIA) was used to measure subjects' immunoglobulin E (IgE) reactivity to collected bioaerosols. RESULTS: Platanus pollen constituted 76% of total pollen between July 2006 and April 2007. Airborne concentrations of Platanus pollen peaked from August until October. Non-Platanus pollen peaked from July to December. Elevated concentrations of trichomes and achene fibers occurred from September to December and August to October, respectively. As determined by SPT, 85.9% of subjects were sensitized, 65.6% to any pollen tested, 56.3% to Lolium perenne, and 23.4% to Platanus. Higher mean daily symptom scores were only associated with high counts of non-Platanus pollens. HIA analysis demonstrated IgE binding to Platanus pollen in all Platanus sensitized subjects. Personal nasal air sampling detected airborne trichomes that were capable of being inhaled. Platanus trichomes or achene fibers did not bind IgE from any subject. CONCLUSIONS: Platanus bioaerosols exist in high concentrations between August and November in inner-urban Sydney but were not associated with seasonal symptoms. Platanus trichomes are inhaled and may constitute a respiratory irritant.",

This study assesses the prevalence of children who missed the birth dose of hepatitis B vaccination and identifies socio-demographic factors associated with non-receipt of the birth dose among children in the United States. METHODS: A survey observation study was conducted with the national representative sample of 17,053 U.S. children aged 19-35months obtained from the 2009 National Immunization Survey. Categorical data analysis and multivariable logistic regression in the context of complex sample survey were applied to evaluate the prevalence and determine the independent risk factors. RESULTS: 39.2% of children missed the birth dose of hepatitis B vaccination. Children who reside in states without a universal hepatitis B vaccine supply policy, are not covered by health insurance, and have only 1 vaccination provider are significantly associated with non-receipt of the birth dose hepatitis B vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Children who reside in states without a universal hepatitis B vaccine supply policy, and who are not covered by health insurance are two important modifiable risk factors for not receiving the birth dose hepatitis B vaccination. Future intervention studies could be needed to help control those modifiable risk factors.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: As part of an evaluation of strategies to make inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) affordable for developing countries, we conducted a clinical trial of fractional doses of IPV in Cuba. METHODS: We compared the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of fractional-dose IPV (0.1 mL, or 1/5 of a full dose) given intradermally using a needle-free jet injector device compared with full doses given intramuscularly. Subjects were randomized at birth to receive IPV at 6, 10, and 14 weeks. RESULTS: A total of 471 subjects were randomized to the 2 study groups, and 364 subjects fulfilled the study requirements. No significant differences at baseline were detected. Thirty days after completing the 3-dose schedule of IPV, 52.9%, 85.0%, and 69.0% of subjects in the fractional-dose IPV arm seroconverted for poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3, respectively, whereas 89.3%, 95.5%, and 98.9% of subjects in the full-dose IPV arm seroconverted for poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3, respectively (all comparisons, P < .001). The median titers of each poliovirus serotype were significantly lower in the intradermal arm than in the intramuscular arm (P < .001). Only minor local adverse effects and no moderate or serious adverse events were reported. CONCLUSIONS: This large-scale evaluation demonstrates the feasibility of fractional doses of IPV given intradermally as an antigen-sparing strategy but also shows that IPV given to infants at 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age results in suboptimal immunogenicity (especially for the fractional-dose arm).",

Twenty-four-hour urine samples were collected in 1948 Chinese adults aged 18 to 69 years. The observed associations of sodium, potassium, sodium-potassium ratio, and systolic blood pressure (SBP) were stronger in the overweight/obese population than among those of normal weight. Among overweight/obese respondents, each additional standard deviation (SD) higher of urinary sodium excretion (SD=85 mmol) and potassium excretion (SD=19 mmol) was associated with a 1.31 mm Hg (95% confidence interval, 0.37-2.26) and -1.43 mm Hg (95% confidence interval, -2.23 to -0.63) difference in SBP, and each higher unit in sodium-potassium ratio was associated with a 0.54 mm Hg (95% confidence interval, 0.34-0.75) increase in SBP. The association between sodium, potassium, sodium-potassium ratio, and prevalence of hypertension among overweight/obese patients was similar to that of SBP. Our study indicated that the relationships between BP and both urinary sodium and potassium might be modified by BMI status in Chinese adults.",

        "abstract": "PROBLEM: Poliovirus transmission remained a public health challenge in western Uttar Pradesh, India in late 2005 and early 2006. In 2006, the India Expert Advisory Group for Polio Eradication concluded that, given the peak incidence of polio among children 6 to 12 months of age, a targeted birth dose of oral polio vaccine may be necessary to interrupt intense poliovirus transmission in high risk areas. APPROACH: The Government of Uttar Pradesh, the National Polio Surveillance Project and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) implemented a pilot birth-dose project aimed at identifying and vaccinating all newborns with a dose of oral polio vaccine within 72 hours of birth in an effort to evaluate operational feasibility and potential impact on population immunity. LOCAL SETTING: The project was piloted in Moradabad district: zone 7 in Moradabad City (urban setting), Kunderki block (rural setting) and in select birthing hospitals. RELEVANT CHANGES: Between July 2006 and February 2007, 9740 newborns were identified, of which 6369 (65%) were vaccinated by project personnel within 72 hours of birth. Project coverage (for total newborns vaccinated) ranged from 39% (in zone 7) to 76% (in Kunderki block) of the estimated number of newborns vaccinated during previous supplemental immunization activities. LESSONS LEARNED: Birth-dose coverage among newborns was lower than expected. Expansion costs were estimated to be high, with marginal impact. The project, however, provided opportunities to strengthen newborn tracking systems which have increased the number of newborns and young infants vaccinated during supplemental immunization activities and enrolled in routine programmes.",

In its aftermath, all public health resources were immediately turned to the response and recovery process. School-located mass influenza vaccination (SLV) clinics were scheduled to begin in 1 week, but were necessarily postponed for a month. The juxtaposition of these 2 major public health events afforded the school district, health department, and other community services an opportunity to see their similarities and adopt the Incident Command System structure to manage the SLV clinics across West Palm Beach County, Florida, a geographically large county. Other lessons were learned during the hurricane concerning organizations and people, processes, and communications, and were applicable to school-located mass influenza vaccination programs, and vice versa. Those lessons are related here.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The burden of residential fire injury and death is substantial. Targeted smoke alarm giveaway and installation programs are popular interventions used to reduce residential fire mortality and morbidity. PURPOSE: To evaluate the cost effectiveness and cost benefit of implementing a giveaway or installation program in a small hypothetic community with a high risk of fire death and injury through a decision-analysis model. METHODS: Model inputs included program costs; program effectiveness (life-years and quality-adjusted life-years saved); and monetized program benefits (medical cost, productivity, property loss and quality-of-life losses averted) and were identified through structured reviews of existing literature (done in 2011) and supplemented by expert opinion. Future costs and effectiveness were discounted at a rate of 3% per year. All costs were expressed in 2011 U.S. dollars. RESULTS: Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) resulted in an average cost-effectiveness ratio (ACER) of $51,404 per quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) saved and $45,630 per QALY for the giveaway and installation programs, respectively. Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) showed that both programs were associated with a positive net benefit with a benefit-cost ratio of 2.1 and 2.3, respectively. Smoke alarm functional rate, baseline prevalence of functional alarms, and baseline home fire death rate were among the most influential factors for the CEA and CBA results. CONCLUSIONS: Both giveaway and installation programs have an average cost-effectiveness ratio similar to or lower than the median cost-effectiveness ratio reported for other interventions to reduce fatal injuries in homes. Although more effort is required, installation programs result in lower cost per outcome achieved compared with giveaways.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Parity is associated with the risk of clinical cardiovascular events and the severity of preclinical atherosclerosis in older subjects. We sought to determine whether childbearing is associated with concurrent changes in cardiovascular risk factors and the progression of carotid intima-media thickness. METHODS: We examined the association between the number of children born during a 6-year period and concurrent changes in cardiovascular risk factors and progression of carotid intima-media thickness in men and women of reproductive age from the Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns study. Complete data for parity and carotid intima-media thickness were available for 1786 subjects (1005 females, 781 males). RESULTS: For females, childbirth during the 6-year follow-up was associated with concurrent reductions in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (Ptrend<0.0001), apolipoprotein A-I (Ptrend<0.0001), and apolipoprotein B (Ptrend=0.01); a redistribution of adiposity to abdominal deposits; and increased progression of carotid intima-media thickness (7.5+/-3.2 mum/birth [mean+/-SEM], P=0.02). The association of childbirth with carotid intima-media thickness progression was not greatly modified by adjustment for concurrent changes in cardiovascular risk factors (fully adjusted: P=0.05). This association was significantly stronger in females than males (Pheterogeneity=0.001), who served as a control group exposed to the social and lifestyle influences of child-rearing but not the biological influences of childbearing. CONCLUSIONS: The progression of carotid atherosclerosis over a 6-year period is increased in females who gave birth during the same period, independent of traditional risk factors. Mechanisms that underlie this observation possibly include parity-induced changes in nontraditional risk factors or an acute influence of pregnancy itself.",

Using data from the Medical Monitoring Project and the National Health Interview Survey, we present nationally representative estimates of the receipt of disability benefits by adults living with HIV receiving care compared with the general US adult population. We found that in 2009, adults living with HIV were nine times more likely than adults in the general population to receive disability benefits. The risk of being on disability is also greater for younger and more educated adults living with HIV compared to the general population, which suggests that productivity losses can result from HIV infection. To prevent disability, early diagnosis and treatment of HIV are essential. This study offers a baseline against which to measure the impacts of recently proposed or enacted changes to Medicaid and private insurance markets, including the Affordable Care Act and proposed revisions to the Social Security Administration's HIV Infection Listings.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted to determine whether the risk of developing multiple sclerosis (MS) was associated with certain environmental exposures or genetic factors previously reported to influence MS risk. This paper describes the methodological issues, study design and characteristics of the study population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Individuals with definite MS were identified from a prevalence study conducted in three geographic areas. The target number of cases was not reached, so an additional study area was added. Identifying clinic controls was inefficient, so controls were recruited using random digit dialing. All study participants completed a detailed questionnaire regarding environmental exposures using computer-assisted telephone interviewing, and blood was collected for genetic analysis. RESULTS: In total, 276 cases and 590 controls participated, but participation rates were low, ranging from 28.4% to 38.9%. Only one-third (33.6%) of individuals identified in the prevalence study agreed to participate in the case-control study. Cases were more likely to be non-Hispanic white and older than their source populations as identified in the preceding prevalence study (P < 0.05). Most participants provided a blood sample for genotyping (91%; n = 789). CONCLUSIONS: Epidemiological studies play a key role in identifying genetic and environmental factors that are associated with complex diseases like MS. Methodological issues arise in every study, and investigators need to be able to detect, respond to and correct problems in a timely and scientifically valid manner.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Currently, no single U.S. surveillance system can provide estimates of the burden of all types of health care-associated infections across acute care patient populations. We conducted a prevalence survey in 10 geographically diverse states to determine the prevalence of health care-associated infections in acute care hospitals and generate updated estimates of the national burden of such infections. METHODS: We defined health care-associated infections with the use of National Healthcare Safety Network criteria. One-day surveys of randomly selected inpatients were performed in participating hospitals. Hospital personnel collected demographic and limited clinical data. Trained data collectors reviewed medical records retrospectively to identify health care-associated infections active at the time of the survey. Survey data and 2010 Nationwide Inpatient Sample data, stratified according to patient age and length of hospital stay, were used to estimate the total numbers of health care-associated infections and of inpatients with such infections in U.S. acute care hospitals in 2011. RESULTS: Surveys were conducted in 183 hospitals. Of 11,282 patients, 452 had 1 or more health care-associated infections (4.0%; 95% confidence interval, 3.7 to 4.4). Of 504 such infections, the most common types were pneumonia (21.8%), surgical-site infections (21.8%), and gastrointestinal infections (17.1%). Clostridium difficile was the most commonly reported pathogen (causing 12.1% of health care-associated infections). Device-associated infections (i.e., central-catheter-associated bloodstream infection, catheter-associated urinary tract infection, and ventilator-associated pneumonia), which have traditionally been the focus of programs to prevent health care-associated infections, accounted for 25.6% of such infections. We estimated that there were 648,000 patients with 721,800 health care-associated infections in U.S. acute care hospitals in 2011. CONCLUSIONS: Results of this multistate prevalence survey of health care-associated infections indicate that public health surveillance and prevention activities should continue to address C. difficile infections. As device- and procedure-associated infections decrease, consideration should be given to expanding surveillance and prevention activities to include other health care-associated infections.",

Thus, we compared the distribution of Lyme disease cases in the United States with the distributions of deaths due to Alzheimer disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), multiple sclerosis (MS), and Parkinson disease; no geographic correlations were identified. Lyme disease incidence per US state was not correlated with rates of death due to ALS, MS, or Parkinson disease; however, an inverse correlation was detected between Lyme disease and Alzheimer disease. The absence of a positive correlation between the geographic distribution of Lyme disease and the distribution of deaths due to Alzheimer disease, ALS, MS, and Parkinson disease provides further evidence that Lyme disease is not associated with the development of these neurodegenerative conditions.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To characterize maternal and infant outcomes for pregnant women who received live H1N1 influenza vaccine and had no reported adverse events. METHODS: We identified Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System reports, which described receipt of live H1N1 vaccine during pregnancy without an indication of an adverse event at the time of the report during October 2009 to June 2010. We reviewed the initial reports and obtained pregnancy outcome and infant data through 6 months of age from medical records. We reviewed the numbers and characteristics of pregnancy complications and infant outcomes including major birth defects and medically important infant conditions. Rates of spontaneous abortion, preterm birth, and major birth defects and their 95% confidence intervals were calculated. RESULTS: The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System received 113 reports stating receipt of live H1N1 vaccine during pregnancy with no adverse events reported. We obtained follow-up maternal records on 95 of the 113 (84%) live H1N1 reports (40.2% were vaccinated in the first trimester) and found: 87 live births (two twin pregnancies) and no maternal deaths occurred. Number and rates of pregnancy-specific adverse events included: 10 (10.5%, 5.8-18.3) spontaneous abortions; four (4.7%, 1.8-11.4) preterm deliveries at 35-36 weeks of gestation; three (3.4%, 1.2-9.7) infants had one or more major birth defects noted at birth: one cleft palate, one cleft lip, and one microtia (underdeveloped or absent external ear). Seven neonates and infants were hospitalized for medically important conditions. One infant death occurred in a 2.5-month-old boy as a result of pertussis. CONCLUSION: Rates of spontaneous abortion, preterm birth, and major birth defects in pregnant women who received live H1N1 vaccine were similar to or lower than published background rates. No concerning patterns of medical conditions in infants were identified. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: III.",

        "abstract": "Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) are very potent toxins and category A biological threat agents. BoNT serotypes/C1 and/D affect birds and mammals and can be potentially lethal to humans. We have previously described the usefulness of the Endopep-MS method to detect the activity of BoNT A through G. This report was followed by the application of the method to clinical samples. The activity of the BoNT serotypes associated with human disease (/A,/B,/E, and/F) was successfully detected. However, BoNT/C and/D require different conditions for fast substrate cleavage and a comprehensive description of a method to study BoNT/C and/D has not yet been reported. This work describes a new, optimized version of the Endopep-MS method to detect BoNTs/C1 and/DC either spiked directly in 20 muL of reaction buffer or spiked in a larger volume of buffer and further extracted using antibody-coated magnetic beads. It was found that the incubation temperature at 42 degrees C was more effective for both toxin serotypes, but each toxin serotype has an optimum cleavage pH. Additionally, we describe for the first time a proteomics study using a fast trypsin digestion method and label-free quantification of these toxin serotypes.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Anogenital human papillomavirus (HPV) infection among men who have sex with men (MSM) is common, leading to morbidity including anal cancer. This study sought to elucidate the determinants of initial anogenital HPV infection among teenage MSM. METHODS: Two hundred MSM aged 16 to 20 years were recruited via community and other sources. Men were tested for HPV DNA from the anal canal and penis, and completed a questionnaire. RESULTS: Median age was 19 years. Men reported a median duration of 1.9 years since first receptive anal sex and a median of 4 receptive anal sex partners. The proportion of men with anal HPV of any type increased from 10.0% in men reporting no prior receptive anal sex to 47.3% in men reporting >/=4 receptive anal sex partners (p <0.001). The proportion with anal HPV type 16 also increased significantly with increasing receptive anal sex partners (p=0.044). The proportion of men with penile HPV increased from 3.7% in men reporting no prior insertive anal sex to 14.8% in men reporting >/=4 insertive anal sex partners (p =0.014). Overall, 39.0% (95% confidence interval (CI): 32.2-46.1%) of men had at least one HPV DNA type detected: 23.0% (95% CI: 17.4-29.5%) with a quadrivalent HPV vaccine preventable type (6, 11, 16 or 18). CONCLUSTION: In this study, early and high per partner transmission of HPV occurred between men soon after their first sexual experiences. HPV vaccination needs to commence early for maximal prevention of HPV among MSM.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: As a first step to determining the public availability of drinking water, self-reported access to water fountains in parks and playgrounds was examined. METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis was conducted on a convenience sample of 4163 US adults (aged >/=18 years) using the 2009 HealthStyles Survey. The outcome measure was reported access to water fountains in parks/playgrounds. Among those who reported using parks/playgrounds, multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the associations between sociodemographic variables and reported access to water fountains. RESULTS: About half (54.7%) of participants used parks/playgrounds. Among those, 55.0% reported access to water fountains. Factors significantly associated with reported access to water fountains were being male [odds ratio (OR) = 1.42; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.09, 1.85] and living in the Pacific region (versus East North Central region, OR = 2.56; 95% CI = 1.61, 4.06). Age, race/ethnicity, household income, marital status, education, smoking and physical activity were not significantly associated with reported access to water fountains. CONCLUSIONS: Among 54.7% of adults using parks/playgrounds, reported access to water fountains was significantly differed by sex and region. This study provides information that can be considered when developing interventions to increase access to drinking water in public facilities.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To estimate trends in prepregnancy obesity prevalence among women who delivered live births in the US during 2003-2009, by state, age, and race-ethnicity. METHODS: We used Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) data from 2003, 2006, and 2009 to measure prepregnancy obesity (body mass index [BMI]>/=30 kg/m2) trends in 20 states. Trend analysis included 90,774 records from 20 US states with data for all 3 study years. We used a chi-square test for trend to determine significance of actual and standardized trends, standardized to the age and race-ethnicity distribution of the 2003 sample. RESULTS: Prepregnancy obesity prevalence increased by an average of 0.5 percentage points per year, from 17.6% in 2003 to 20.5% in 2009 (P<0.001). Obesity increased among women aged 20-24 (P<0.001), 30-34 (P=0.001) and 35 years or older (P=0.003), and among non-Hispanic white (P < .001), non-Hispanic black (P=0.02), Hispanic (P=0.01), and other women (P=0.03). CONCLUSION: Overall, prepregnancy obesity prevalence continues to increase and varies by race-ethnicity and maternal age. These findings highlight the need to address obesity as a key component of preconception care, particularly among high-risk groups.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The estimated number of new HIV infections in the United States reflects the leading edge of the epidemic. Previously, CDC estimated HIV incidence in the United States in 2006 as 56,300 (95% CI: 48,200-64,500). We updated the 2006 estimate and calculated incidence for 2007-2009 using improved methodology. METHODOLOGY: We estimated incidence using incidence surveillance data from 16 states and 2 cities and a modification of our previously described stratified extrapolation method based on a sample survey approach with multiple imputation, stratification, and extrapolation to account for missing data and heterogeneity of HIV testing behavior among population groups. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Estimated HIV incidence among persons aged 13 years and older was 48,600 (95% CI: 42,400-54,700) in 2006, 56,000 (95% CI: 49,100-62,900) in 2007, 47,800 (95% CI: 41,800-53,800) in 2008 and 48,100 (95% CI: 42,200-54,000) in 2009. From 2006 to 2009 incidence did not change significantly overall or among specific race/ethnicity or risk groups. However, there was a 21% (95% CI:1.9%-39.8%; p = 0.017) increase in incidence for people aged 13-29 years, driven by a 34% (95% CI: 8.4%-60.4%) increase in young men who have sex with men (MSM). There was a 48% increase among young black/African American MSM (12.3%-83.0%; p<0.001). Among people aged 13-29, only MSM experienced significant increases in incidence, and among 13-29 year-old MSM, incidence increased significantly among young, black/African American MSM. In 2009, MSM accounted for 61% of new infections, heterosexual contact 27%, injection drug use (IDU) 9%, and MSM/IDU 3%. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Overall, HIV incidence in the United States was relatively stable 2006-2009; however, among young MSM, particularly black/African American MSM, incidence increased. HIV continues to be a major public health burden, disproportionately affecting several populations in the United States, especially MSM and racial and ethnic minorities. Expanded, improved, and targeted prevention is necessary to reduce HIV incidence.",

        "abstract": "DNA sequences from the mitochondrial cytochrome-b gene were obtained from 41 specimens of Neotoma albigula from the southwestern United States and northwestern México. Phylogenetic analyses depicted that samples of N. a. melanura from southern Sonora and northern Sinaloa formed a clade separate from representatives of the other sampled subspecies of N. albigula (albigula, laplataensis, mearnsi, seri, sheldoni, and venusta). Genetic distances detected between these clades (7.41%) approached divergence levels reported for other sister species of woodrats and indicated that N. a. melanura is presumably a cryptic and genetically differentiated species relative to N. albigula. Analyses of DNA sequences from a nuclear gene (intron 2 of the alcohol dehydrogenase gene, Adh1-I2) indicated that samples of N. a. melanura formed a separate, monophyletic clade relative to the remainder of N. albigula. Further, habitat, geographic distinctions, and morphological differences were apparent between members of the 2 clades. Together, those data support the elevation of N. a. melanura to species status.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Excessive sodium intake is a key modifiable risk factor for hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Although 95% of U.S. adults exceed intake recommendations, knowledge is limited regarding whether doctor or health professional advice motivates patients to reduce intake. Our objectives were to describe the prevalence and determinants of taking action to reduce sodium, and to test whether receiving advice was associated with action. METHODS: Analyses, conducted in 2014, used data from the 2013 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, a state-based telephone survey representative of non-institutionalized adults. Respondents (n=173,778) from 26 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico used the new optional sodium module. We estimated prevalence ratios (PRs) based on average marginal predictions, accounting for the complex survey design. RESULTS: Fifty-three percent of adults reported taking action to reduce sodium intake. Prevalence of action was highest among adults who received advice (83%), followed by adults taking antihypertensive medications, adults with diabetes, adults with kidney disease, or adults with a history of cardiovascular disease (range, 73%-75%), and lowest among adults aged 18-24 years (29%). Overall, 23% of adults reported receiving advice to reduce sodium intake. Receiving advice was associated with taking action (prevalence ratio=1.59; 95% CI=1.56, 1.61), independent of sociodemographic and health characteristics, although some disparities were observed across race/ethnicity and BMI categories. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that more than half of U.S. adults in 26 states and two territories are taking action to reduce sodium intake, and doctor or health professional advice is strongly associated with action.",

Several species of Gemella are known to cause endocarditis. Here, we report the first case in Thailand of G. bergeri endocarditis whose blood culture was negative using routine methods but was positive by PCR identification of bacteria in the affected valve. A 37-year-old male presented with prolonged fever, weight loss, and dyspnea on exertion. By transthoracic echocardiography, he was suspected of having infective endocarditis of the tricuspid valve. The patient underwent tricuspid valve repair and vegetectomy. Routine hospital blood cultures were negative but G. bergeri was identified by PCR/sequencing of the heart valve tissue.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Homeless adults have an increased risk of infectious diseases due to sexual and drug-related behaviors and substandard living conditions. We investigated the prevalence and risk factors for presence of hepatitis A virus (HAV) antibodies among homeless and marginally housed adults. METHODS: We analyzed serologic and questionnaire data from a study of marginally housed and homeless adults in San Francisco from April 1999 to March 2000. We tested seroprevalance for total antibodies to HAV (anti-HAV) and analyzed data using Chi-square tests and logistic regression. RESULTS: Of the 1,138 adults in the study, 52% were anti-HAV positive. The anti-HAV prevalence in this study population was 58% higher than the expected prevalence based on age-specific prevalence rates from the general population. Number of years of homelessness (< or =1, 2-4, and > or =5 years) was associated with anti-HAV prevalence (46%, 50%, and 61%, respectively, p < 0.001). We found other differences in anti-HAV prevalence (p < 0.05) for ever having injected drugs (63% vs. 42% for non-injectors), being foreign-born (75% vs. 51% among U.S.-born), race/ethnicity (72%, 53%, and 45% for Hispanic, white, and black people, respectively), and increasing age (38%, 49%, and 62% among those aged <35, 35-45, and >45 years, respectively). These variables all remained significant in a multivariate model. CONCLUSIONS: We found overall anti-HAV prevalence elevated in this San Francisco homeless population compared with the general U.S. population. These data show that anti-HAV was associated with homelessness independent of other known risk factors, such as being foreign-born, race/ethnicity, and injection drug use. This increase indicates an excess risk of HAV infection and the potential need to offer hepatitis A vaccination as part of homeless services.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In the context of increasing obesity prevalence, the relationship between large visceral adipose tissue (VAT) volumes and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is unclear. In a clinical sample of severely obese women (mean body mass index [BMI], 46 kg/m(2)) with fasting normoglycemia (n = 40) or dysglycemia (impaired fasting glucose + diabetes; n = 20), we sought to determine the usefulness of anthropometric correlates of VAT and associations with dysglycemia. METHODS: VAT volume was estimated using multi-slice computer tomography; anthropometric surrogates included sagittal abdominal diameter (SAD), waist circumference (WC) and BMI. Insulin sensitivity (Si), and beta-cell dysfunction, measured by insulin secretion (AIRg) and the disposition index (DI), were determined by frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test. RESULTS: Compared to fasting normoglycemic women, individuals with dysglycemia had greater VAT (P < 0.001) and SAD (P = 0.04), but BMI, total adiposity and Si were similar. VAT was inversely associated with AIRg and DI after controlling for ancestry, Si, and total adiposity (standardized beta, -0.32 and -0.34, both P < 0.05). In addition, SAD (beta = 0.41, P = 0.02) was found to be a better estimate of VAT volume than WC (beta = 0.32, P = 0.08) after controlling for covariates. Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that VAT volume, followed by SAD, outperformed WC and BMI in identifying dysglycemic participants. CONCLUSIONS: Increasing VAT is associated with beta-cell dysfunction and dysglycemia in very obese women. In the presence of severe obesity, SAD is a simple surrogate of VAT, and an indicator of glucose dysregulation.",

        "abstract": "The global spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome highlighted the need to detect and control disease outbreaks at their source, as envisioned by the 2005 revised International Health Regulations (IHR). June 2012 marked the initial deadline by which all 194 World Health Organization (WHO) member states agreed to have IHR core capacities fully implemented for limiting the spread of public health emergencies of international concern. Many countries fell short of these implementation goals and requested a 2-year extension. The degree to which achieving IHR compliance will result in global health security is not clear, but what is clear is that progress against the threat of epidemic disease requires a focused approach that can be monitored and measured efficiently. We developed concrete goals and metrics for 4 of the 8 core capacities with other US government partners in consultation with WHO and national collaborators worldwide. The intent is to offer an example of an approach to implementing and monitoring IHR for consideration or adaptation by countries that complements other frameworks and goals of IHR. Without concrete metrics, IHR may waste its considerable promise as an instrument for global health security against public health emergencies.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Smear-negative tuberculosis (TB) is difficult to diagnose and has been associated with poor treatment outcomes and excessive mortality, particularly in high human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevalent settings. However, few studies have used mycobacterial culture to rigorously confirm all smear-negative TB cases in a population-based cohort. DESIGN: We included all culture-confirmed, pulmonary TB cases reported to the US National TB Surveillance System from 1993 to 2008. We analyzed smear-negative TB risk factors and survival, as compared to smear-positive TB. We calculated prevalence ratios (PRs) and adjusted for confounders (aPR). RESULTS: From 1993 to 2008, 159,121 cases of culture-confirmed pulmonary TB were reported in the United States, of which 58,786 (37%) were sputum smear-negative. Smear-negative TB cases were more likely to be foreign-born (aPR 1.10, 95%CI 1.08-1.12), incarcerated (aPR 1.52, 95%CI 1.48-1.56) or HIV-infected (aPR 1.27, 95%CI 1.24-1.30). Hispanics and non-Hispanic Blacks were less likely to have smear-negative TB (respectively aPR 0.87, 95%CI 0.85-0.89 and aPR 0.90, 95%CI 0.89-0.92). Smear-negative TB cases had lower mortality (aRR 0.78, 95%CI 0.74-0.81), independent of HIV status. CONCLUSION: Smear-negative TB represents a large proportion of TB cases in the United States, and occurs more often among persons in groups more likely to undergo TB screening. The lower mortality may indicate earlier TB detection, and underscores the need for continued vigilance in screening of high-risk persons.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: In March, 2006, oral rotavirus vaccine was added to Brazil's infant immunization schedule with recommended upper age limits for initiating (by age 14 weeks) and completing (by age 24 weeks) the two-dose series to minimize age-specific risk of intussusception following rotavirus vaccination. Several years after introduction, estimated coverage with rotavirus vaccine (83%) was lower compared to coverage for other recommended childhood immunizations (>/=94%). METHODS: We analyzed data from Brazil's national immunization program on uptake of oral rotavirus vaccine by geographic region and compared administrative coverage estimates for first and second doses of oral rotavirus vaccine (Rota1 and Rota2) with first and second doses of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis-Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (DTP-Hib1 and DTP-Hib2). For 27 Brazilian cities, we compared differences between estimated rotavirus and DTP-Hib coverage in 2010 with delayed receipt of DTP-Hib vaccine among a cohort of children surveyed before rotavirus introduction. RESULTS: In 2010, infant vaccination coverage was 99.0% for DTP-Hib1 versus 95.2% for Rota1 (3.8% difference), and 98.4% for DTP-Hib2 versus 83.0% for Rota2 (15.4% difference), with substantial regional variation. Differences between DTP-Hib and rotavirus vaccination coverage in Brazilian cities correlated with delay in DTP-Hib vaccination among children surveyed. Age restrictions for initiating and completing the rotavirus vaccination series likely contributed to lower coverage with rotavirus vaccine in Brazil. CONCLUSION: To maximize benefits of rotavirus vaccination, strategies are needed to improve timeliness of routine immunizations; monitoring rotavirus vaccine uptake and intussusception risk is needed to guide further recommendations for rotavirus vaccination.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Although persons who inject drugs have high prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, few receive treatment mostly because of lack of knowledge about the infection and its treatment. We assessed the level of HCV-related knowledge and willingness to participate in HCV treatment among methadone-maintained patients. METHODS: A 30-item survey covering HCV-related knowledge and willingness to engage in HCV-related education and treatment was developed and completed by 320 methadone-maintained patients. RESULTS: Respondents' mean age was 53 +/- 8.7 years, 59.5% were male, 55.1% were African American, and 38.3% were Hispanic. The mean duration of methadone maintenance was 7 +/- 6.7 years. In the preceding 6 months, 6.9% of patients reported injection drug use, whereas 37.3% used noninjection drugs. Hepatitis C virus seropositivity was self-reported by 46.3% of patients. The majority of patients (78%) expressed willingness to participate in HCV-related education and to receive HCV treatment. Most patients (54.7%) correctly answered 5 or more of 7 questions assessing HCV knowledge. Hepatitis C virus-seropositive individuals and prior attendees at HCV-related educational activities demonstrated a higher level of HCV-related knowledge (P < 0.001 and P = 0.002, respectively). Younger patients (P = 0.014), those willing to attend an HCV-related educational activity (P < 0.001), and those with higher-HCV-related knowledge (P = 0.029) were more accepting of HCV treatment. Fear of medication-related side effects was the most common reason for treatment avoidance. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients reported willingness to receive HCV-related education and treatment. Treatment willingness was significantly associated with previous attendance at an HCV educational activity and a higher level of HCV-related knowledge.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: To assess the association between four positive youth development (PYD) constructs of confidence and adolescent sexual and reproductive health (ASRH) outcomes. METHODS: We searched nine online databases to locate behavioral research that examined the association between four constructs of confidence (belief in the future, self-determination, clear and positive identity, and self-efficacy) and ASRH outcomes (e.g., ever had sex, condom use, contraception use, number of partners, pregnancy/birth, and sexually transmitted infection). Findings were coded as \"protective,\" \"risk,\" or \"no association.\" The presence of at least two longitudinal studies reporting consistent significant associations for at least one ASRH outcome indicated evidence for a protective or risk association. RESULTS: We found evidence to support two of the four PYD constructs of confidence (belief in the future and self-determination) as protective factors for ASRH outcomes. Evidence was insufficient to draw conclusions about clear and positive identity as a protective factor, and was mixed for self-efficacy. Measures of confidence varied considerably across the studies reviewed, reflecting varying definitions; often, the measures used had limited information on reliability. Few longitudinal investigations were identified, and available studies were inconsistent in how they examined the association between the PYD constructs and ASRH outcomes. Evidence for most constructs was insufficient to identify their influence on specific sub-groups of youth. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the need for additional research, this review suggests that belief in the future and self-determination are promising protective factors. Further research is needed to better understand the potential for self-efficacy and clear and positive identity as protective factors.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: An isolated focus on 1 disease at a time is insufficient to generate the scientific evidence needed to improve the health of persons living with more than 1 chronic condition. This article explores how to bring context into research efforts to improve the health of persons living with multiple chronic conditions (MCC). METHODS: Forty-five experts, including persons with MCC, family and friend caregivers, researchers, policy makers, funders, and clinicians met to critically consider 4 aspects of incorporating context into research on MCC: key contextual factors, needed research, essential research methods for understanding important contextual factors, and necessary partnerships for catalyzing collaborative action in conducting and applying research. RESULTS: Key contextual factors involve complementary perspectives across multiple levels: public policy, community, health care systems, family, and person, as well as the cellular and molecular levels where most research currently is focused. Needed research involves moving from a disease focus toward a person-driven, goal-directed research agenda. Relevant research methods are participatory, flexible, multilevel, quantitative and qualitative, conducive to longitudinal dynamic measurement from diverse data sources, sufficiently detailed to consider what works for whom in which situation, and generative of ongoing communities of learning, living and practice. Important partnerships for collaborative action include cooperation among members of the research enterprise, health care providers, community-based support, persons with MCC and their family and friend caregivers, policy makers, and payers, including government, public health, philanthropic organizations, and the business community. CONCLUSION: Consistent attention to contextual factors is needed to enhance health research for persons with MCC. Rigorous, integrated, participatory, multimethod approaches to generate new knowledge and diverse partnerships can be used to increase the relevance of research to make health care more sustainable, safe, equitable and effective, to reduce suffering, and to improve quality of life.",

The authors conducted qualitative analyses of reports, success stories, and MDCH grantees' interview responses (via follow-up call with 3 coalitions) to assess key barriers, facilitators, and lessons learned for coalitions implementing breastfeeding support groups. Coalitions noted implementation barriers related to their organizational structure and to recruiting mothers and finding meeting locations. Facilitators to implementing breastfeeding support groups included referrals, expertise, resources, and incentives. The following themes emerged from the reports analysis regarding how to implement breastfeeding support groups: \"meet moms where they are,\" build community partnerships, and leverage in-kind and financial resources to sustain breastfeeding support groups.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Treatment data for prostate cancer can be obtained from a variety of sources. Each of these sources has its own strengths and weaknesses and is subject to error. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a population-based cohort of 319 prostate cancer patients, data on treatment were obtained from five sources: two patient interviews at 6 and 12 months after diagnosis, primary caregiver interviews, physician questionnaires, and medical records. Inter-reporting agreement and accuracy of reporting (compared with medical records) were assessed. Multivariate analyses examined patient, caregiver, and physician characteristics as determinants of reporting error. RESULTS: The agreement among different reporting methods was generally good to excellent for prostatectomy and brachytherapy (kappa range 0.70-0.90) and fair to good (kappa range 0.35-0.75) for external beam radiation and hormonal treatment. Compared with medical records, the interview- and questionnaire-based data collection methods were more accurate for prostatectomy and brachytherapy than for external beam radiation and hormonal therapy. Using medical records as the 'gold standard', patient and caregiver interviews at 6 months after the diagnosis had higher sensitivity and specificity than other reporting sources. CONCLUSION: Interviews of prostate cancer patients and caregivers are useful alternatives to medical record abstraction, particularly if carried out during, or soon after, treatment.",

This study evaluated commercial DNA purification methods for isolating Ricinus communis DNA as measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Four commercially available DNA purification methods (two automated, MagNA Pure compact and MagNA Pure LC, and two manual, MasterPure complete DNA and RNA purification kit and QIAamp DNA blood mini kit) were evaluated. We compared their ability to purify detectable levels of R. communis DNA from four different sample types, including crude preparations of ricin that could be used for biological crimes or acts of bioterrorism. Castor beans, spiked swabs, and spiked powders were included to simulate sample types typically tested during criminal and public health investigations. Real-time PCR analysis indicated that the QIAamp kit resulted in the greatest sensitivity for ricin preparations; the MasterPure kit performed best with spiked powders. The four methods detected equivalent levels by real-time PCR when castor beans and spiked swabs were used. All four methods yielded DNA free of PCR inhibitors as determined by the use of a PCR inhibition control assay. This study demonstrated that DNA purification methods differ in their ability to purify R. communis DNA; therefore, the purification method used for a given sample type can influence the sensitivity of real-time PCR assays for R. communis.",

The aim of our study was to examine associations between health-professional diagnosed work-related asthma (WRA) and current depression and the effect of current depression on the associations of WRA with adverse asthma outcomes. METHOD: We analyzed data from the 2006 and 2008 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Asthma Call-Back Survey and the Anxiety and Depression Module conducted in 25 states and District of Columbia for ever-employed adults with current asthma. We computed weighted proportions and prevalence ratios adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, current employment status, and smoking status. Survey participants who were ever told by a doctor or other health professional that their asthma was related to any job they ever had were determined to have WRA. Participants with current depression were identified using self-report of depressive symptoms. RESULTS: Of ever-employed adults with current asthma, an estimated 9.1% had WRA and 17.0% had current depression. Persons with WRA were significantly more likely than those with non-WRA to have current depression. Persons with either WRA, current depression, or both WRA and current depression were significantly more likely to have adverse asthma outcomes than persons with asthma and neither condition. The associations with adverse asthma outcomes were stronger when both current depression and WRA were present. LIMITATIONS: This is a cross-sectional and hypothesis-generating study. CONCLUSIONS: Depression may play an important role in asthma management and should be considered when assessing patients with asthma and, in particular, those with WRA.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hormonal contraceptives are important for the health and wellbeing of some women living with HIV, so evaluation of evidence regarding their safety vis-a-vis HIV-related risks is important. METHODS: We updated two prior systematic reviews on the impact of hormonal contraception (HC) on HIV disease progression and female-to-male HIV transmission. RESULTS: One new study finds no increased risk for HIV disease progression or death associated with oral contraceptive use (adj HR 0.83, CI 0.48-1.44) or injectables (adj HR 0.72, CI 0.53-0.98). Three new studies did not find significantly increased risks for measures of female-to-male HIV transmission with HC use. CONCLUSIONS: Hormonal contraceptive methods do not appear to accelerate HIV disease progression. More research is needed to clarify whether HC impacts HIV transmissibility.",

        "abstract": "DESCRIPTION: After HIV diagnosis, timely entry into HIV medical care and retention in that care are essential to the provision of effective antiretroviral therapy (ART). Adherence to ART is among the key determinants of successful HIV treatment outcome and is essential to minimize the emergence of drug resistance. The International Association of Physicians in AIDS Care convened a panel to develop evidence-based recommendations to optimize entry into and retention in care and ART adherence for people with HIV. METHODS: A systematic literature search was conducted to produce an evidence base restricted to randomized, controlled trials and observational studies with comparators that had at least 1 measured biological or behavioral end point. A total of 325 studies met the criteria. Two reviewers independently extracted and coded data from each study using a standardized data extraction form. Panel members drafted recommendations based on the body of evidence for each method or intervention and then graded the overall quality of the body of evidence and the strength for each recommendation. RECOMMENDATIONS: Recommendations are provided for monitoring entry into and retention in care, interventions to improve entry and retention, and monitoring of and interventions to improve ART adherence. Recommendations cover ART strategies, adherence tools, education and counseling, and health system and service delivery interventions. In addition, they cover specific issues pertaining to pregnant women, incarcerated individuals, homeless and marginally housed individuals, and children and adolescents, as well as substance use and mental health disorders. Recommendations for future research in all areas are also provided.",

The separation is based on cell size difference, and conducted in a custom-made biocompatible ferrofluid that retains the viability of cells during and after the assay for downstream analysis. The scheme offers moderate-throughput (≈106 cells h-1 for a single channel device) and extremely high recovery rate (>99%) without the use of any label. It is envisioned that this separation scheme will have clinical applications in settings where rapid cell enrichment and removal of contaminating blood will improve efficiency of screening and diagnosis such as cervical cancer screening based on mixed populations in exfoliated samples.",

        "abstract": "Healthy aging must become a priority objective for both population and personal health services, and will require innovative prevention programming to span those systems. Uptake of essential clinical preventive services is currently suboptimal among adults, owing to a number of system- and office-based care barriers. To achieve maximum health results, prevention must be integrated across community and clinical settings. Many preventive services are portable, deliverable in either clinical or community settings. Capitalizing on that flexibility can improve uptake and health outcomes. Significant reductions in health disparities, mortality, and morbidity, along with decreases in health spending, are achievable through improved collaboration and synergy between population health and personal health systems.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Racial and ethnic disparities are well documented in many areas of health care, but have not been comprehensively evaluated among recipients of heart transplants. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of 39075 adult primary heart transplant recipients from 1987 to 2009 using national data from the United Network of Organ Sharing and compared mortality for nonwhite and white patients using the Cox proportional hazards model. During the study period, 8082 nonwhite and 30 993 white patients underwent heart transplantation. Nonwhite heart transplant recipients increased over time, comprising nearly 30% of transplantations since 2005. Nonwhite recipients had a higher clinical risk profile than white recipients at the time of transplantation, but had significantly higher posttransplantation mortality even after adjustment for baseline risk. Among the nonwhite group, only black recipients had an increased risk of death compared with white recipients after multivariable adjustment for recipient, transplant, and socioeconomic factors (hazard ratio, 1.34; 95% confidence interval, 1.21 to 1.47; P<0.001). Five-year mortality was 35.7% (95% confidence interval, 35.2 to 38.3) among black and 26.5% (95% confidence interval, 26.0 to 27.0) among white recipients. Black patients were more likely to die of graft failure or a cardiovascular cause than white patients, but less likely to die of infection or malignancy. Although mortality decreased over time for all transplant recipients, the disparity in mortality between blacks and whites remained essentially unchanged. CONCLUSIONS: Black heart transplant recipients have had persistently higher mortality than whites recipients over the past 2 decades, perhaps because of a higher rate of graft failure.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study evaluated the effectiveness of a program in which a workers' compensation (WC) insurer provided matching funds to insured employers to implement safety/health engineering controls. METHODS: Pre- and post-intervention WC metrics were compiled for the employees designated as affected by the interventions within 468 employers for interventions occurring from 2003 to 2009. Poisson, two-part, and linear regression models with repeated measures were used to evaluate differences in pre- and post-data, controlling for time trends independent of the interventions. RESULTS: For affected employees, total WC claim frequency rates (both medical-only and lost-time claims) decreased 66%, lost-time WC claim frequency rates decreased 78%, WC paid cost per employee decreased 81%, and WC geometric mean paid claim cost decreased 30% post-intervention. Reductions varied by employer size, specific industry, and intervention type. CONCLUSIONS: The insurer-supported safety/health engineering control program was effective in reducing WC claims and costs for affected employees.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Four spotted fever group rickettsiae (SFGR) are known to infect humans in the United States. A member of the SFGR designated 364D and detected in Dermacentor occidentalis ticks has not previously been identified as a human pathogen. METHODS: An 80-year-old man from a rural northern California community presented with an eschar on his forearm. A skin punch biopsy of the lesion was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and molecular analysis. Serum specimens obtained from the patient and 3 other area residents with similar illnesses were tested by immunofluorescence and Western immunoblot for antibodies to SFGR. Ticks were collected near the patient's residence and tested for SFGR. RESULTS: Abundant intracellular rickettsiae and fragmented rickettsial antigens were observed in the mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates of the biopsy. Nucleotide sequences of DNA fragments amplified from the biopsy were identical to those of 364D. Convalescent sera from all four patients exhibited high immunoglobulin G titers to Rickettsia rickettsii, Rickettsia rhipicephali, and 364D antigens. Three adult D. occidentalis were positive for 364D, R. rhipicephali, and an unidentified Rickettsia species. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first confirmation of human disease associated with the SFGR 364D, which was likely transmitted by D. occidentalis. Although the patients described here presented with a single cutaneous eschar as the principal manifestation, the full spectrum of illness associated with 364D has yet to be determined. Possible infection with 364D or other SFGR should be confirmed through molecular techniques in patients who present with \"spotless\" Rocky Mountain spotted fever or have serum antibodies to R. rickettsii with group-specific assays.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: To determine which medications are most commonly used by women in the first trimester of pregnancy and identify the critical gaps in information about fetal risk for those medications. METHODS: Self-reported first-trimester medication use was assessed among women delivering liveborn infants without birth defects and serving as control mothers in two large case-control studies of major birth defects. The Teratology Information System (TERIS) expert Advisory Board ratings of quality and quantity of data available to assess fetal risk were reviewed to identify information gaps. RESULTS: Responses from 5381 mothers identified 54 different medication components used in the first trimester by at least 0.5% of pregnant women, including 31 prescription and 23 over-the-counter medications. The most commonly used prescription medication components reported were progestins from oral contraceptives, amoxicillin, progesterone, albuterol, promethazine, and estrogenic compounds. The most commonly used over-the-counter medication components reported were acetaminophen, ibuprofen, docusate, pseudoephedrine, aspirin, and naproxen. Among the 54 most commonly used medications, only two had \"Good to Excellent\" data available to assess teratogenic risk in humans, based on the TERIS review. CONCLUSIONS: For most medications commonly used in pregnancy, there are insufficient data available to characterize the fetal risk fully, limiting the opportunity for informed clinical decisions about the best management of acute and chronic disorders during pregnancy. Future research efforts should be directed at these critical knowledge gaps.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Although A1C is now recommended to diagnose diabetes, its test performance for diagnosis and prognosis is uncertain. Our objective was to assess the test performance of A1C against single and repeat glucose measurements for diagnosis of prevalent diabetes and for prediction of incident diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted population-based analyses of 12,485 participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study and a subpopulation of 691 participants in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) with repeat test results. RESULTS: Against a single fasting glucose >/=126 mg/dl, the sensitivity and specificity of A1C >/=6.5% for detection of prevalent diabetes were 47 and 98%, respectively (area under the curve 0.892). Against repeated fasting glucose (3 years apart) >/=126 mg/dl, sensitivity improved to 67% and specificity remained high (97%) (AUC 0.936). Similar results were obtained in NHANES III against repeated fasting glucose 2 weeks apart. The accuracy of A1C was consistent across age, BMI, and race groups. For individuals with fasting glucose >/=126 mg/dl and A1C >/=6.5% at baseline, the 10-year risk of diagnosed diabetes was 88% compared with 55% among those individuals with fasting glucose >/=126 mg/dl and A1C 5.7-<6.5%. CONCLUSIONS: A1C performs well as a diagnostic tool when diabetes definitions that most closely resemble those used in clinical practice are used as the \"gold standard.\" The high risk of diabetes among individuals with both elevated fasting glucose and A1C suggests a dual role for fasting glucose and A1C for prediction of diabetes.",

        "abstract": "In the United States, injury is the leading cause of death for persons aged 1-44 years, and the approximately 800,000 emergency medical services (EMS) providers have a substantial impact on the care of injured persons and on public health. At an injury scene, EMS providers determine the severity of injury, initiate medical management, and identify the most appropriate facility to which to transport the patient through a process called \"field triage.\" Although basic emergency services generally are consistent across hospital emergency departments (EDs), certain hospitals have additional expertise, resources, and equipment for treating severely injured patients. Such facilities, called \"trauma centers,\" are classified from Level I (centers providing the highest level of trauma care) to Level IV (centers providing initial trauma care and transfer to a higher level of trauma care if necessary) depending on the scope of resources and services available. The risk for death of a severely injured person is 25% lower if the patient receives care at a Level I trauma center. However, not all patients require the services of a Level I trauma center; patients who are injured less severely might be better served by being transported to a closer ED capable of managing milder injuries. Transferring all injured patients to Level I trauma centers might overburden the centers, have a negative impact on patient outcomes, and decrease cost effectiveness. In 1986, the American College of Surgeons developed the Field Triage Decision Scheme (Decision Scheme), which serves as the basis for triage protocols for state and local EMS systems across the United States. The Decision Scheme is an algorithm that guides EMS providers through four decision steps (physiologic, anatomic, mechanism of injury, and special considerations) to determine the most appropriate destination facility within the local trauma care system. Since its initial publication in 1986, the Decision Scheme has been revised four times. In 2005, with support from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, CDC began facilitating revision of the Decision Scheme by hosting a series of meetings of the National Expert Panel on Field Triage, which includes injury-care providers, public health professionals, automotive industry representatives, and officials from federal agencies. The Panel reviewed relevant literature, presented its findings, and reached consensus on necessary revisions. The revised Decision Scheme was published in 2006. This report describes the process and rationale used by the Expert Panel to revise the Decision Scheme.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To examine relationships between prenatal perfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) exposure and adiposity in children born to women who lived downstream from a fluoropolymer manufacturing plant. METHODS: Data are from a prospective cohort in Cincinnati, Ohio (HOME Study). Perfluorooctanoic (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonic (PFOS), perfluorononanoic (PFNA), and perfluorohexane sulfonic (PFHxS) acids were measured in prenatal serum samples. Differences were measured in body mass index z-scores (BMI), waist circumference, and body fat at 8 years of age (n = 204) and BMI between 2-8 years of age (n = 285) according to PFAS concentrations. RESULTS: Children born to women in the top two PFOA terciles had greater adiposity at 8 years than children in the 1st tercile. For example, waist circumference (cm) was higher among children in the 2nd (4.3; 95% CI: 1.7, 6.9) and 3rd tercile (2.2; 95% CI: -0.5, 4.9) compared to children in the 1st tercile. Children in the top two PFOA terciles also had greater BMI gains from 2 to 8 years compared to children in the 1st tercile (P < 0.05). PFOS, PFNA, and PFHxS were not associated with adiposity. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort, higher prenatal serum PFOA concentrations were associated with greater adiposity at 8 years and a more rapid increase in BMI between 2-8 years.",

The median age was 18 years; 77.6% were male. The overall case fatality rate was 4%, but adults 45 years or older were five times as likely to die as 5-29 year olds. Other factors associated with increased mortality included HIV infection, edema, severe malnutrition, pneumonia, tuberculosis, and vomiting. The VL epidemic expanded rapidly over a several-year period, culminating in an epidemic peak in the last third of 2005, spread over two districts, and transformed into a sustained endemic situation by 2007.",

However, a lack of reagents, especially for flow cytometry of immune cell subsets, has limited research in this model. Here we use a panel of primarily species cross-reactive antibodies to identify ferret T cells, cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), B cells, and granulocytes in peripheral blood. Following infection with seasonal H3N2 or H1N1pdm09 influenza viruses, these cell types showed rapid and dramatic changes in frequency, even though clinically the infections were mild. The loss of B cells and CD4 and CD8 T cells, and the increase in neutrophils, were especially marked 1-2 days after infection, when about 90% of CD8+ T cells disappeared from the peripheral blood. The different virus strains led to different kinetics of leukocyte subset alterations. Vaccination with homologous vaccine reduced clinical symptoms slightly, but led to a much more rapid return to normal leukocyte parameters. Assessment of clinical symptoms may underestimate the effectiveness of influenza vaccine in restoring homeostasis.",

One application of this approach has been to identify candidate genes that may play a role in the course and severity of C. trachomatis GTI in women, using human clinical and genetic data together with results obtained in the female mouse model to guide the selection process This model has been proven robust enough: i) to identify stable phenotypic differences in the course and outcome of GTI among commonly used immunocompetent inbred mouse stains that are used in the construction of gene knockout (KO) and transgenic mice; as well as ii) to serve as a platform in which to assess the influence of genetic differences among human genital tract isolates of C. trachomatis as well as between this biovar and the mouse biovar, Chlamydia muridarum. This review presents a summary of published and unpublished results from 25 years of studies in immunodeficient and gene-deficient KO mice that both inform our present understanding of the immunogenetics of C. trachomatis GTI and serve to guide candidate gene selection.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Maternal nutrition during pregnancy is known to have an effect on fetal growth and development. It is recommended that women increase their calcium intake during pregnancy and lactation, although the recommended dosage varies among professionals. Currently, there is no consensus on the role of routine calcium supplementation for pregnant women other than for preventing or treating hypertension. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of calcium supplementation on maternal, fetal and neonatal outcomes (other than for preventing or treating hypertension) as well as any possible side effects. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (17 March 2011). SELECTION CRITERIA: We considered all published, unpublished and ongoing randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing maternal, fetal and neonatal outcomes in pregnant women who received calcium supplementation versus placebo or no treatment. We excluded quasi- and pseudo-RCTs. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors identified studies for inclusion and extracted the data. Two review authors performed data analysis. MAIN RESULTS: This review includes data from 21 studies (involving 16,602 women). There were no statistically significant differences between women who received calcium supplementation and those who did not in terms of reducing preterm births (less than 37 weeks' gestation) (risk ratio (RR) 0.90; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 1.11; 12 studies, 15615 women; random-effects model) and also in less than 34 weeks' gestation (RR 1.11; 95% CI 0.84 to 1.46; three trials, 5145 women). There was no significant difference in infant low birth weight between the two groups (RR 0.91; 95% CI 0.72 to 1.16; four trials, 13449 infants; random-effects). However, compared to the control group, women in the calcium supplementation group gave birth to slightly heavier birth weight infants (mean difference (MD) 64.66 g; 95% CI 15.75 to 113.58; 19 trials, 8287 women; random-effects). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Calcium supplementation is associated with a significant protective benefit in the prevention of pre-eclampsia, and should be used for this indication according to a previous review. This review indicates that there are no additional benefits for calcium supplementation in prevention of preterm birth or low infant birth weight. While there was a statistically significant difference of 80 g identified in mean infant birth weight, there was significant heterogeneity identified, and the clinical significance of this difference is uncertain.",

Using data from this registry and a provider survey, we estimated the number of all pH1N1 vaccine doses administered. Of 2.8 million doses distributed during October 1, 2009-March 4, 2010, a total of 988,298 doses were administered and reported; another 172,289 doses were administered but not reported, for a total of 1,160,587 doses administered during this period. Reported doses represented an estimated 80%-85% of actual doses administered. Reporting by a wide range of provider types was feasible during a pandemic. Pediatric-care providers had the highest reporting rate (93%). Other private-care providers who routinely did not report vaccinations indicated that they had few, if any, problems, thereby suggesting that mandatory reporting of all vaccines would be feasible.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Foreign-born persons are considered at higher risk of undervaccination and exposure to many vaccine-preventable diseases. Information on vaccination coverage among foreign-born populations is limited. PURPOSE: To assess adult vaccination coverage disparities among foreign-born populations in the U.S. METHODS: Data from the 2012 National Health Interview Survey were analyzed in 2013. For non-influenza vaccines, the weighted proportion vaccinated was calculated. For influenza vaccination, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to assess coverage among individuals interviewed during September 2011-June 2012 and vaccinated in August 2011-May 2012. RESULTS: Overall, unadjusted vaccination coverage among U.S.-born respondents was significantly higher than that of foreign-born respondents: influenza, age >/=18 years (40.4% vs 33.8%); pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV), 18-64 years with high-risk conditions (20.8% vs 13.7%); PPV, >/=65 years (62.6% vs 40.5%); tetanus vaccination, >/=18 years (65.0% vs 50.6%); tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis (Tdap), >/=18 years (15.5% vs 9.3%); hepatitis B, 18-49 years (37.2% vs 28.4%); shingles, >/=60 years (21.3% vs 12.0%); and human papilloma virus (HPV), women 18-26 years (38.7% vs 14.7%). Among the foreign born, vaccination coverage was generally lower for non-U.S. citizens, recent immigrants, and those interviewed in a language other than English. Foreign-born individuals were less likely than U.S.-born people to be vaccinated for pneumococcal (>/=65 years), tetanus, Tdap, and HPV (women) after adjusting for confounders. CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination coverage is lower among foreign-born adults than those born in the U.S. It is important to consider foreign birth and immigration status when assessing vaccination disparities and planning interventions.",

Researchers analyzed differences in population characteristics (e.g., percentage of births at > or =2,500 g) for each group. Compared with their base populations, control participants did not differ in distributions of maternal or paternal age, previous livebirths, maternal smoking, or diabetes, but they did differ in other maternal (i.e., race/ethnicity, education, entry into prenatal care) and infant (i.e., birth weight, gestational age, and plurality) characteristics. Differences in distributions of maternal, but not infant, characteristics were associated with participation by selected controls. Absolute differences in infant characteristics for the base population versus control participants were < or =1.3 percentage points. Differences in infant characteristics were greater at centers that selected controls from hospitals compared with centers that selected controls from electronic birth certificates. These findings suggest that control participants in the National Birth Defects Prevention Study generally are representative of their base populations. Hospital-based control selection may slightly underascertain infants affected by certain adverse birth outcomes.",

        "abstract": "A traumatic brain injury (TBI) is caused by a bump, blow, jolt, or penetrating wound to the head that disrupts the normal functioning of the brain. In 2009, CDC estimated that at least 2.4 million emergency department visits, hospitalizations, or deaths were related to a TBI, either alone or in combination with other injuries. Approximately 75% of TBIs are mild, often called concussions. Children, adolescents, and older adults are most likely to sustain a TBI. Nearly one third (30.5%) of all injury deaths included a diagnosis of TBI. In addition, an estimated 5.3 million U.S. residents are living with TBI-related disabilities, including long-term cognitive and psychologic impairments. A severe TBI not only affects a person's life and family, but also has a large societal and economic toll. The economic costs of TBIs in 2010 were estimated at $76.5 billion, including $11.5 billion in direct medical costs and $64.8 billion in indirect costs (e.g., lost wages, lost productivity, and nonmedical expenditures). These data underestimate the national burden because they include neither TBIs managed in nonhospital settings nor >31,000 military personnel diagnosed with TBI and treated in the U.S. Department of Defense or Veterans Administration medical systems in 2010.",

        "abstract": "The clinical spectrum of human disease caused by the roundworms Toxocara canis and Toxocara cati ranges from visceral and ocular larva migrans to covert toxocariasis. The parasite is not typically recovered in affected tissues, so detection of parasite-specific antibodies is usually necessary for establishing a diagnosis. The most reliable immunodiagnostic methods use the Toxocara excretory-secretory antigens (TES-Ag) in ELISA formats to detect Toxocara-specific antibodies. To eliminate the need for native parasite materials, we identified and purified immunodiagnostic antigens using 2D gel electrophoresis followed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Three predominant immunoreactive proteins were found in the TES; all three had been previously described in the literature: Tc-CTL-1, Tc-TES-26, and Tc-MUC-3. We generated Escherichia coli expressed recombinant proteins for evaluation in Luminex based immunoassays. We were unable to produce a functional assay with the Tc-MUC-3 recombinant protein. Tc-CTL-1 and Tc-TES-26 were successfully coupled and tested using defined serum batteries. The use of both proteins together generated better results than if the proteins were used individually. The sensitivity and specificity of the assay for detecting visceral larval migrans using Tc-CTL-1 plus Tc-TES-26 was 99% and 94%, respectively; the sensitivity for detecting ocular larval migrans was 64%. The combined performance of the new assay was superior to the currently available EIA and could potentially be employed to replace current assays that rely on native TES-Ag.",

        "abstract": "Between December 2007 and July 2008, three neonates in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) in Salford, UK, were diagnosed with primary cutaneous aspergillosis (PCA) due to Aspergillus fumigatus. The first PCA case, in December 2007, developed multi-organ failure leading to death within a short time frame: the other two cases survived after treatment with intravenous antifungal therapy followed by oral posaconazole. Air, surface, and water samples were collected within the NICU and from the incubators that were occupied by the neonates. All recovered fungal isolates were confirmed as A. fumigatus by sequencing the beta-tubulin region. Microsatellite strain typing demonstrated genotypically related A. fumigatus isolates from the neonates and the humidity chambers (HCs) of the neonates' incubators, suggesting that the source of the infection may have been the HCs/incubators used in the NICU. Aspergillus strain typing may be a useful tool in clinical outbreak settings to help understand the source of exposure and to design targeted environmental interventions to prevent future infections.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Two doses of measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine are 97% effective against measles, but waning antibody immunity to measles and failure of the 2-dose vaccine occur. We administered a third MMR dose (MMR3) to young adults and assessed immunogenicity over 1 year. METHODS: Measles virus (MeV) neutralizing antibody concentrations, cell-mediated immunity (CMI), and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody avidity were assessed at baseline and 1 month and 1 year after MMR3 receipt. RESULTS: Of 662 subjects at baseline, 1 (0.2%) was seronegative for MeV-neutralizing antibodies (level, <8 mIU/mL), and 23 (3.5%) had low antibody levels (8-120 mIU/mL). One month after MMR3 receipt, 1 subject (0.2%) was seronegative, and 6 (0.9%) had low neutralizing antibodies, with only 21 of 662 (3.2%) showing a >/=4-fold rise in neutralizing antibodies. One year after MMR3 receipt, no subject was seronegative, and 10 of 617 (1.6%) had low neutralizing antibody levels. CMI analyses showed low levels of spot-forming cells after stimulation, suggesting the presence of T-cell memory, but the response was minimal after MMR3 receipt. MeV IgG avidity did not correlate with findings of neutralization analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Most subjects were seropositive before MMR3 receipt, and very few had a secondary immune response after MMR3 receipt. Similarly, CMI and avidity analyses showed minimal qualitative improvements in immune response after MMR3 receipt. We did not find compelling data to support a routine third dose of MMR vaccine.",

        "abstract": "Lofa County has one of the highest cumulative incidences of Ebola virus disease (Ebola) in Liberia. Recent situation reports from the Liberian Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MoHSW) have indicated a decrease in new cases of Ebola in Lofa County. In October 2014, the Liberian MoHSW requested the assistance of CDC to further characterize recent trends in Ebola in Lofa County. Data collected during June 8-November 1, 2014 from three sources were analyzed: 1) aggregate data for newly reported cases, 2) case-based data for persons admitted to the dedicated Ebola treatment unit (ETU) for the county, and 3) test results for community decedents evaluated for Ebola. Trends from all three sources suggest that transmission of Ebola virus decreased as early as August 17, 2014, following rapid scale-up of response activities in Lofa County after a resurgence of Ebola in early June 2014. The comprehensive response strategy developed with participation from the local population in Lofa County might serve as a model to implement in other affected areas to accelerate control of Ebola.",

However, the development of effective and long-lasting HuNoV vaccines and therapeutics has been greatly hindered by their uncultivability. We recently demonstrated that a HuNoV replicates in human B cells, and that commensal bacteria serve as a cofactor for this infection. In this protocol, we provide detailed methods for culturing the GII.4-Sydney HuNoV strain directly in human B cells, and in a coculture system in which the virus must cross a confluent epithelial barrier to access underlying B cells. We also describe methods for bacterial stimulation of HuNoV B cell infection and for measuring viral attachment to the surface of B cells. Finally, we highlight variables that contribute to the efficiency of viral replication in this system. Infection assays require 3 d and attachment assays require 3 h. Analysis of infection or attachment samples, including RNA extraction and RT-qPCR, requires approximately 6 h.",

        "abstract": "Bioassays and biochemical assays were conducted on eight Trinidadian strains of Aedes aegypti larvae to determine the involvement of biochemical mechanisms in resistance to insecticides. Larval strains were assayed to dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), bendiocarb, temephos and permethrin, using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) time-mortality bioassay method. A Resistance Threshold (RT) was calculated for each insecticide in relation to the CAREC reference susceptible Ae. aegypti strain and larval strains with <80% mortality were considered to be resistant. Biochemical assays were performed to determine the activities of nonspecific esterases (alpha- and beta-), PNPA-esterases, mixed function oxidases (MFO), glutathione-S-transferases (GST) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzymes which are involved in insecticide resistance in mosquitoes. Enzyme profiles of each strain were compared with those of the CAREC reference susceptible strain by Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn's multiple comparison tests (p<0.05). The CAREC 99th percentile was calculated for each enzyme and the percentage of individuals with enzyme activities above that of the CAREC 99th percentile was calculated. Activities were classified as unaltered (<50%), incipiently altered (15-50%) or altered (>50%) for each strain. The established RTs for permethrin and bendiocarb were 30 and 75 min, respectively; and 120 min for DDT and temephos. All strains were resistant to DDT (1.00-40.25% mortality) and temephos (11.50-74.50% mortality) while six strains were resistant to bendiocarb (51.50-78.50% mortality) and five to permethrin (6.50-42.50% mortality). Biochemical assays revealed that the median activity levels for all enzymes varied significantly (p<0.05). The Curepe strain had incipiently altered levels of alpha-esterase while the other seven strains had altered activity with five of them registering 100%. The St Clair strain showed altered activity levels of beta-esterase while three strains had incipiently altered levels. The majority of strains had altered activity of MFO enzymes but only the St Clair strain showed altered activity of GST. PNPA-esterases activity was unaltered in all strains and only the Haleland Park strain showed altered remaining AChE activity in the presence of propoxur. Elevated levels of enzymes (incipiently altered or altered), except in the case of PNPA-esterases, show that biochemical resistance may play an important role in the manifestation of insecticide resistance in Trinidadian populations of Ae. aegypti. It is therefore important for insecticide resistance surveillance to be ongoing as the detection of resistance before it spreads throughout an entire population makes it possible for early intervention.",

        "abstract": "Since the 2001 U.S. federally mandated phase-out of residential uses of organophosphates (OPs), use of and potential for human exposure to pyrethroids in the indoor residential environment has increased. We report concentrations of common pyrethroids, pyrethroid metabolites, and chlorpyrifos in floor wipes, and urinary concentrations of pyrethroid metabolites and 3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCPy) in samples collected in 2007-2009 from 90 northern California families as part of the Study of Use of Products and Exposure Related Behavior (SUPERB). Correlation and regression analyses examined associations between floor wipe and urine sample concentrations. The most frequently detected urinary metabolites were TCPy (64.7%, median concentration of 1.47 ng/mL) and 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (3PBA) (62.4%, 0.79 ng/mL). Compared to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2001-2002 general U.S. population, this population had substantially higher pyrethroid metabolite and lower TCPy urinary concentrations. This may be related to the increased residential use of pyrethroids after the phase-out of OPs. Chlorpyrifos (98.7%), cis- and trans-permethrin (97.5%), bifenthrin (59.3%), and 3PBA (98.7%) were frequently detected in the floor wipes. Floor wipe concentrations for pyrethroid insecticides were found to be significant predictors of child creatinine-adjusted urinary metabolite concentrations (log-log regression coefficients ranging from 0.26 to 0.29; p < 0.05) suggesting that indoor residential exposure to pyrethroid insecticides is an important exposure route for children.",

        "abstract": "The biodynamic response functions of the human whole-body system measured with subjects participating in an experiment are commonly arithmetically averaged and used to represent their mean response functions in many studies. The reported means were further averaged to form the reference means for standardization and various applications. The objectives of this study are to clarify whether this response-based averaging process could significantly misrepresent the characteristics of the original functions, and to explore appropriate methods for deriving representative functions. A set of reported mechanical-equivalent models for 12 subjects was used to derive the vertical and fore-and-aft cross-axis response functions expressed in apparent mass. The response-based average was directly compared with the response derived from a property-based derivation method. This study found that the response-based average could differ from the property-based mean response by more than 30%, especially in the fore-and-aft cross-axis response functions. This study also theoretically demonstrated that the discrepancies result from the non-linear relationship between the apparent mass and the properties of a dynamic system. Therefore, the discrepancies depend on the variability of the subjects' dynamic properties. Practically, the discrepancies in the vertical response could be reduced to an acceptable level (e.g., <10%) if a sufficient number of subjects with similar body weights are selected or grouped in the measurement. However, it is very difficult to reduce the discrepancies in the fore-and-aft cross-axis to such a level. While more demanding than the response-based method, the property-based method is theoretically more reliable for deriving the representative response functions for each axis.",

        "abstract": "To determine the major factors affecting the urinary levels of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) among county noxious weed applicators in Kansas, we used a regression technique that accounted for multiple days of exposure. We collected 136 12-h urine samples from 31 applicators during the course of two spraying seasons (April to August of 1994 and 1995). Using mixed-effects models, we constructed exposure models that related urinary 2,4-D measurements to weighted self-reported work activities from daily diaries collected over 5 to 7 days before the collection of the urine sample. Our primary weights were based on an earlier pharmacokinetic analysis of turf applicators; however, we examined a series of alternative weighting schemes to assess the impact of the specific weights and the number of days before urine sample collection that were considered. The derived models accounting for multiple days of exposure related to a single urine measurement seemed robust with regard to the exact weights, but less to the number of days considered; albeit the determinants from the primary model could be fitted with marginal losses of fit to the data from the other weighting schemes that considered a different numbers of days. In the primary model, the total time of all activities (spraying, mixing, other activities), spraying method, month of observation, application concentration, and wet gloves were significant determinants of urinary 2,4-D concentration and explained 16% of the between-worker variance and 23% of the within-worker variance of urinary 2,4-D levels. As a large proportion of the variance remained unexplained, further studies should be conducted to try to systematically assess other exposure determinants.",

        "abstract": "We assessed factors associated with HIV care among HIV-infected men who have sex with men (MSM). We used 2008 data on MSM from the National HIV Behavioral Surveillance System (NHBS). Venue-based, time-space sampling was used to recruit and interview men in 21 U.S. cities with high AIDS prevalence. Among self-reported HIV-positive MSM, we used generalized estimating equations (clustered on city of interview) to evaluate factors associated with delayed linkage to care (care entry >3 months after diagnosis), not currently receiving care (no visit for HIV care during the 6 months before the study interview), and not being on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Among 8,153 MSM, 882 (11 %) were self-reported HIV-positive. 25 % had delayed linkage, 12 % were not currently receiving care and among those with at least one heath care visit 30 % were not on ART. In multivariate analysis, lower income and testing positive at their first HIV test were associated with delayed linkage. Age 18-29 years, and not having health insurance were associated with not currently receiving care. Among those with at least one health care visit, being age 18-39 years, having private or no health insurance, and stimulant use were associated with not being on ART. These findings can inform efforts to improve engagement in care.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To determine the relationship between glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and free prostate-specific antigen (fPSA), percent-free PSA (%fPSA), and total PSA (tPSA) in patients with diminished kidney function not on dialysis, using nationally representative data. METHODS: A total of 3782 men aged >/= 40 years who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2001-2006, and who met eligibility criteria for PSA testing were included in the final study population. GFR (mL/min/1.73 m(2)) was calculated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation 7 and categorized as >/= 90, 60 to < 90, and 15 to < 60. Distribution of tPSA, fPSA, and %fPSA were estimated by GFR category and by age and race. Multivariate linear regression models were fit to determine the adjusted relationship between GFR and tPSA and %fPSA after adjusting for age, race, and body mass index. RESULTS: The multivariate linear regression analysis showed that GFR had a linear relationship with tPSA that was of borderline significance. There was a significant nonlinear relationship between GFR and %fPSA (P <.001): increased GFR was associated with a decrease in %fPSA for GFR levels below 90 [eg, change in %fPSA = -2.67 (95% CI -3.56, -1.77) for a GFR of 85 as compared with 65; P <.001]. The decline in %fPSA with increasing GFR was nonsignificant for GFR levels above 90. CONCLUSIONS: Our finding that renal function as measured by GFR is negatively associated with %fPSA has potential implications for use of this test in men with renal disease.",

        "abstract": "Additional findings are presented from a 2012 nationwide survey of 2,072 occupational health nurses regarding how they achieved competence in respiratory protection, their preferred methods of learning, and how they motivated employees to use respiratory protection. On-the-job training, taking a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health spirometry course, or attending professional conferences were the primary ways occupational health nurses gained respiratory protection knowledge. Attending professional conferences was the preferred method of learning, varying by type of industry and years of occupational health nurse experience. Employee motivational strategies were not widely used; the most common strategy was to tailor respiratory protection training to workplace culture. Designing training methods that match learning preferences, within the context of the organization's safety and quality improvement culture, is a key recommendation supported by the literature and these findings. Including respiratory protection content and competencies in all levels of academic nursing education is an additional recommendation. Additional research is needed to link training strategies with consistent and correct use of respiratory protection by employees.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: To examine evidence of the continuity in abusive discipline across two generations (G1 and G2) and the role of safe, stable, and nurturing relationships (SSNRs) as protective factors. METHODS: Data are from the Lehigh Longitudinal Study, a prospective investigation of the causes and consequences child maltreatment that began in the 1970s with a sample of 457 children and their parents. Data were most recently collected in 2008-2010 from 80% of the original child sample (N = 357) when they were adults age 36 years on average. Of those assessed as adults, 268 participants (G2s) were parenting children and thus comprise the analysis sample. Analyses examined the association between harsh physical discipline practices by G1 parents and G2's reports of similarly severe discipline practices used in parenting their own children. Analyses also investigated the direct and interactive (protective) effects of SSNR variables that pertain to the care, warmth, and support children received from their mothers, fathers, and siblings over their lifetimes. A measure of an adult partner's warmth and support was also included. A case-level examination of G2 harsh discipliners was included to investigate other forms of past and more recent forms of abuse exposure. RESULTS: Results show a significant predictive association between physical discipline by G1 and G2 parents (beta = .30; p < .05; odds ratio, 1.14; confidence interval, 1.04-1.26), after accounting for childhood socioeconomic status and gender. Whereas being harshly disciplined as a child was inversely related to reports of having had a caring relationship with one's mother (r = -.25; p < .01), only care and support from one's father predicted a lower risk of harsh physical discipline by G2s (beta = -.24; p < .05; odds ratio, .74; confidence interval, .59-.92). None of the SSNR variables moderated the effect of G1 discipline on G2 discipline. A case-level examination of the abusive histories of G2 harsh discipliners found they had in some instances been exposed to physical and emotional abuse by multiple caregivers and by adult partners. CONCLUSIONS: There is continuity in physical disciplining over two generations. SSNRs measured in this study did not mediate or moderate the effect of G1 on G2 harsh physical discipline, although care and support from fathers was inversely related to the likelihood of G2 harsh physical discipline. This relationship is independent of abuse in childhood. Research is needed to identify factors that interrupt the intergenerational continuity of harsh physical (abusive) disciplining so that promising interventions can be developed and implemented.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cancer is one of the top five most costly diseases in the United States and leads to substantial work loss. Nevertheless, limited state-level estimates of cancer absenteeism costs have been published. METHODS: In analyses of data from the 2004-2008 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, the 2004 National Nursing Home Survey, the U.S. Census Bureau for 2008, and the 2009 Current Population Survey, we used regression modeling to estimate annual state-level absenteeism costs attributable to cancer from 2004 to 2008. RESULTS: We estimated that the state-level median number of days of absenteeism per year among employed cancer patients was 6.1 days and that annual state-level cancer absenteeism costs ranged from $14.9 million to $915.9 million (median = $115.9 million) across states in 2010 dollars. Absenteeism costs are approximately 6.5% of the costs of premature cancer mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The results from this study suggest that lost productivity attributable to cancer is a substantial cost to employees and employers and contributes to estimates of the overall impact of cancer in a state population.",

        "abstract": "The use of gold nanoparticles coated with an organic monolayer of thiol for application in chemiresistive sensors was initiated in the late 1990s; since then, such types of sensors have been widely pursued due to their high sensitivities and reversible responses to volatile organic compounds (VOCs). However, a major issue for chemical sensors based on thiol-capped gold nanoparticles is their poor long-term stability as a result of slow degradation of the monothiol-to-gold bonds. We have devised a strategy to overcome this limitation by synthesizing a more robust system using Au nanoparticles capped by trithiol ligands. Compared to its monothiol counterpart, the new system is significantly more stable and also shows improved sensitivity towards different types of polar or non-polar VOCs. Thus, the trithiol-Au nanosensor shows great promise for use in real world applications.",

We examined the association between COPD and increased confusion and memory loss (ICML) and functional limitations among adults with COPD. METHODS: We studied adults aged 45 years or older in 21 states who participated in the 2011 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (n = 102,739). Presence of COPD was based on self-reported physician diagnosis. ICML was based on self-report that confusion or memory loss occurred more often or worsened during the prior year. ICML-associated difficulties were defined as giving up household chores and former activities, decreased ability to work or engage in social activities, or needing help from family or friends during the prior year due to ICML. General limitations were defined as needing special equipment as a result of a health condition, having had activity limitations for 2 weeks or more in the prior month, or being unable to work. Multivariable models were adjusted for demographics, health behaviors or conditions, and frequent mental distress. RESULTS: COPD was reported by 9.3% of adults. ICML was greater among those with COPD than among those without COPD (25.8% vs 11%; adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR], 1.48; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.32%-1.66%). People with COPD, either with or without ICML, were more likely than those without COPD to report general functional limitations. Among people reporting ICML, those with COPD were more likely to report interference with work or social activities than those without COPD (aPR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.01%-1.36%). CONCLUSION: Functional limitations were greater among those with COPD than among those without, and ICML may further affect these limitations. Results from our study can inform future studies of self- management and functional limitations for people with COPD.",

We used data from FluSurv-NET, a national population-based surveillance system for laboratory-confirmed influenza hospitalizations, to capture diagnostic test type by patient age and influenza season. We calculated observed rates by age group and adjusted rates by test sensitivity. Test sensitivity was lowest in adults >65 years of age. For all ages, reverse transcription PCR was the most sensitive test, and use increased from <10% during 2003-2008 to approximately 70% during 2009-2013. Observed hospitalization rates per 100,000 persons varied by season: 7.3-50.5 for children <18 years of age, 3.0-30.3 for adults 18-64 years, and 13.6-181.8 for adults >65 years. After 2009, hospitalization rates adjusted by test sensitivity were approximately 15% higher for children <18 years, approximately 20% higher for adults 18-64 years, and approximately 55% for adults >65 years of age. Test sensitivity adjustments improve the accuracy of hospitalization rate estimates.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The number of HIV-related hospitalizations has decreased worldwide in recent years owing to the availability of highly active antiretroviral therapy. However, the change in HIV-related hospitalizations in Portugal has not been studied. Using comprehensive hospital discharge data from mainland Portuguese hospitals, we examined trends in HIV-related inpatient admissions, length of stay (LOS), Elixhauser comorbidity measures, in-hospital mortality, and mean cost from 2000 to 2010. METHODS: The hospital administrative data from inpatient admissions and discharges at 75 public acute care hospitals in the Portuguese National Health Service from 2000 to 2010 were included. HIV-related admissions were identified using the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis codes 042.x-044.x. The effect of Elixhauser comorbidity measures on extending the LOS was assessed by comparing admissions in HIV patients with and without comorbidities using the Mann-Whitney U test. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to estimate the odds of having a decreased discharge. RESULTS: A total of 57,027 hospital admissions were analyzed; 73% of patients were male, and the mean age was 39 years. The median LOS was 11 days, and the in-hospital mortality was 14%. The mean cost per hospitalization was 5,148.7euro. A total of 83% of admissions were through the emergency room. During the period, inpatient HIV admissions decreased by 22%, LOS decreased by 9%, and in-hospital mortality dropped by 12%. Elixhauser comorbidities increased the median LOS in nearly all admissions. CONCLUSIONS: Despite small regional variations, a strong, consistent decrease was observed in the hospital admission rate, mean cost, length of stay, and mortality rate for HIV-related admissions in Portugal during 2000-2010.",

We evaluated the epidemiology of rickets and vitamin D deficiency in Alaska native (AN) children in 2001-2010. METHODS: We analyzed 2001-2010 visits with rickets or vitamin D deficiency diagnosis for AN and American Indian children and the general US population aged <10 years. We conducted a case-control study of AN rickets/vitamin D deficient cases and age- and region-matched controls. RESULTS: In AN children, annual rickets-associated hospitalization rate (2.23/100,000 children/year) was higher than the general US rate (1.23; 95% CI 1.08-1.39). Rickets incidence increased with latitude. Rickets/vitamin D deficiency cases were more likely to have malnutrition (OR 38.1; 95% CI 4.9-294), had similar breast-feeding prevalence, and were less likely to have received vitamin D supplementation (OR 0.23; 95% CI 0.1-0.87) than controls. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the importance of latitude, malnutrition, and lack of vitamin D supplementation as risk factors for rickets.",

        "abstract": "Data from the 2003-2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) indicate that about 3.6 million people in the United States have antibodies to the hepatitis C virus, of whom 2.7 million are currently infected. NHANES, however, excludes several high-risk populations from its sampling frame, including people who are incarcerated, homeless, or hospitalized; nursing home residents; active-duty military personnel; and people living on Indian reservations. We undertook a systematic review of peer-reviewed literature and sought out unpublished presentations and data to estimate the prevalence of hepatitis C in these excluded populations and in turn improve the estimate of the number of people with hepatitis C in the United States. The available data do not support a precise result, but we estimated that 1.0 million (range 0.4 million-1.8 million) persons excluded from the NHANES sampling frame have hepatitis C virus antibody, including 500,000 incarcerated people, 220,000 homeless people, 120,000 people living on Indian reservations, and 75,000 people in hospitals. Most are men. An estimated 0.8 million (range 0.3 million-1.5 million) are currently infected. Several additional sources of underestimation, including nonresponse bias and the underrepresentation of other groups at increased risk of hepatitis C that are not excluded from the NHANES sampling frame, were not addressed in this study. CONCLUSION: The number of US residents who have been infected with hepatitis C is unknown but is probably at least 4.6 million (range 3.4 million-6.0 million), and of these, at least 3.5 million (range 2.5 million-4.7 million) are currently infected; additional sources of potential underestimation suggest that the true prevalence could well be higher.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: We examined whether occupational and household tasks contributed to differences in pain between African Americans and whites with radiographic knee osteoarthritis (OA). METHODS: Participants from the Johnston County Osteoarthritis Project self-reported the frequency (often/always vs never/seldom/sometimes) of performing 9 occupational tasks involving lower extremity joint loading at their longest job (N = 868) and current job (N = 273), as well as 8 household tasks ever performed (N = 811) and currently being performed (N = 767). The associations of the numbers of occupational or household tasks with the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain subscale were first examined in simple linear regression models. If significantly associated with greater pain, each of these was included in adjusted linear regression models to examine whether the association of race with pain remained statistically significant. RESULTS: African Americans reported significantly greater WOMAC pain scores than whites. Exposures to more occupational tasks at the longest job and the current job were associated with greater WOMAC pain scores (p < 0.01). The association of race with greater pain scores remained statistically significant when controlling for occupational tasks at the longest job, but was reduced by 26% and no longer significant when controlling for the number of current occupational tasks. Exposures to an increasing number of household tasks were associated with lower pain scores and were not further analyzed. CONCLUSION: Current performance of physically demanding occupational tasks contributed to racial differences in pain severity among individuals with knee OA. Better workplace policies to accommodate OA-related limitations may help to reduce racial differences in pain.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The Cambodian National Influenza Center (NIC) monitored and characterized circulating influenza strains from 2009 to 2011. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Sentinel and study sites collected nasopharyngeal specimens for diagnostic detection, virus isolation, antigenic characterization, sequencing and antiviral susceptibility analysis from patients who fulfilled case definitions for influenza-like illness, acute lower respiratory infections and event-based surveillance. Each year in Cambodia, influenza viruses were detected mainly from June to November, during the rainy season. Antigenic analysis show that A/H1N1pdm09 isolates belonged to the A/California/7/2009-like group. Circulating A/H3N2 strains were A/Brisbane/10/2007-like in 2009 before drifting to A/Perth/16/2009-like in 2010 and 2011. The Cambodian influenza B isolates from 2009 to 2011 all belonged to the B/Victoria lineage represented by the vaccine strains B/Brisbane/60/2008 and B/Malaysia/2506/2004. Sequences of the M2 gene obtained from representative 2009-2011 A/H3N2 and A/H1N1pdm09 strains all contained the S31N mutation associated with adamantanes resistance except for one A/H1N1pdm09 strain isolated in 2011 that lacked this mutation. No reduction in the susceptibility to neuraminidase inhibitors was observed among the influenza viruses circulating from 2009 to 2011. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that A/H3N2 strains clustered each year to a distinct group while most A/H1N1pdm09 isolates belonged to the S203T clade. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In Cambodia, from 2009 to 2011, influenza activity occurred throughout the year with peak seasonality during the rainy season from June to November. Seasonal influenza epidemics were due to multiple genetically distinct viruses, even though all of the isolates were antigenically similar to the reference vaccine strains. The drug susceptibility profile of Cambodian influenza strains revealed that neuraminidase inhibitors would be the drug of choice for influenza treatment and chemoprophylaxis in Cambodia, as adamantanes are no longer expected to be effective.",

A hydroxyethylthioethyl (HETE) ester-adducted tripeptide, produced by pronase digestion of human serum albumin, was selected as the quantitative exposure biomarker. Cibacron Blue enrichment was developed from an established cartridge method into a 96-well plate format, increasing throughput and ruggedness. This new method decreased sample volume 2.5-fold. Addition of a precipitation and solid-phase extraction concentration step increased the sensitivity of the method. With the conversion to a 96-well plate and optimization of chromatography, the method resulted in a 3-fold decrease in analysis time. Inclusion of a confirmation ion has increased specificity. The method was found to be linear between 0.050 and 50 microM sulfur mustard exposure with a precision for both quality control samples of </=6.5% relative standard deviation and an accuracy of >96%. The limit of detection (3So) was calculated to be approximately 0.0048 microM, an exposure value similar to that of the HETE-albumin adduct method first described by Noort and co-workers (Noort et al., 1999; Noort el al., 2004) which used protein precipitation to isolate albumin. A convenience set of 124 plasma samples from healthy unexposed individuals was analyzed using this method to assess background levels of exposure to sulfur mustard; no positive results were detected.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Information on health disparities between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal populations is essential for developing public health programs aimed at reducing such disparities. The lack of data on disparities in birth outcomes between Inuit and non-Inuit populations in Canada prompted us to compare birth outcomes in Inuit-inhabited areas with those in the rest of the country and in other rural and northern areas of Canada. METHODS: We conducted a cohort study of all births in Canada during 1990-2000 using linked vital data. We identified 13 642 births to residents of Inuit-inhabited areas and 4 054 489 births to residents of all other areas. The primary outcome measures were preterm birth, stillbirth and infant death. RESULTS: Compared with the rest of Canada, Inuit-inhabited areas had substantially higher rates of preterm birth (risk ratio [RR] 1.45, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.381.52), stillbirth (RR 1.68, 95% CI 1.38-2.04) and infant death (RR 3.61, 95% CI 3.17-4.12). The risk ratios and absolute differences in risk for these outcomes changed little over time. Excess mortality was observed for all major causes of infant death, including congenital anomalies (RR 1.64), immaturityrelated conditions (RR 2.96), asphyxia (RR 2.43), sudden infant death syndrome (RR 7.15), infection (RR 8.32) and external causes (RR 7.30). Maternal characteristics accounted for only a small part of the risk disparities. Substantial risk ratios for preterm birth, stillbirth and infant death remained when the comparisons were restricted to other rural or northern areas of Canada. INTERPRETATION: The Inuit-inhabited areas had much higher rates of preterm birth, stillbirth and infant death compared with the rest of Canada and with other rural and northern areas. There is an urgent need for more effective interventions to improve maternal and infant health in Inuit-inhabited areas.",

OBJECTIVE: The usual sodium intake above the Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (ULs), potassium intakes above Adequate Intakes (AIs), the sodium:potassium ratio, and sodium density (mg/kcal) among US infants and preschoolers by age group, as applicable, were estimated and compared by race-ethnicity and current breastfeeding status. DESIGN: Data were analyzed among 3 groups of children (aged 7-11 mo, 1-3 y, and 4-5 y) from the NHANES 2003-2010 by using measurement error models. RESULTS: Seventy-nine percent of children aged 1-3 y and 87% of those aged 4-5 y exceeded their sodium UL; among non-Hispanic black children, the estimates were 84% and 97%, respectively. For potassium, 97% of infants, 5% of children aged 1-3 y, and 0.4% aged 4-5 y met their AIs. Compared with non-Hispanic whites and Mexican Americans, non-Hispanic black infants and preschoolers had higher mean sodium density and sodium:potassium ratios. Currently breastfed infants and children consumed, on average, less sodium than those who were not breastfed (382 +/- 53 compared with 538 +/- 22 mg in those aged 7-11 mo and 1154 +/- 88 compared with 1985 +/- 24 mg in those aged 1-3 y, respectively), but the sodium:potassium ratio did not differ. CONCLUSIONS: Most US preschoolers, particularly non-Hispanic blacks, consume too much sodium, and nearly all do not consume enough potassium. Data that suggest that currently breastfed infants consume less sodium than do those who are not breastfeeding merit further investigation.",

Research on rapid analytical methods that can allow analyses of large numbers of people who may become internally contaminated with radionuclides due to a RN accident is still limited. To contribute to this bioassay capacity for emergency response, the Radiation Protection Bureau of Health Canada has identified and evaluated two new portable SpectraMax plate readers (model 250 and Plus 384) and one brand of dry reagent strips for rapid measurement of creatinine in spot urine samples. Concentrations of creatinine in spot urine samples provide a means of adjusting or normalizing urine collections to 24 h, upon which accurate internal dose assessments due to the radionuclides can be made. Preliminary test results of the devices showed the two SpectraMax plate readers and the TECO dry creatinine reagent strips were portable, rapid and reliable for urinary creatinine measurements in spot samples, suggesting they can be used in rapid dose screening of people.",

        "abstract": "CONTEXT: Food insecurity disproportionately affects U.S. demographic groups of children and adult family members at the highest risk for obesity and may lead to weight gain through various pathways. This article reviews research regarding the relationship between food insecurity and weight status, and the potential role of federal food and nutrition assistance programs. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A search for relevant peer-reviewed research studies among U.S. children and nonelderly adults, published between 2000 and March 2010, identified 42 studies regarding the relationship between food insecurity and weight status. There were 22 studies regarding the potential role of food and nutrition assistance programs. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Among children and men, support for an association between food insecurity and weight status has been mixed. Women who experience food insecurity are more likely to be overweight or obese compared to women with adequate household resources for food; however, there is little evidence that food insecurity promotes increased weight gain over time. Long-term participation in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program may increase risk for excess weight gain. CONCLUSIONS: Additional research addressing the limitations of current studies is needed to fully understand the observed linkages between food insecurity and risk for obesity. Nevertheless, there is substantial evidence these nutritional problems coexist, and it is critical that future efforts to eliminate hunger consider opportunities to promote healthy food choices and physical activity. Evaluations of policy changes and other intervention strategies are needed to determine the potential for food and nutrition assistance programs to more effectively reduce obesity among participants.",

In order to develop tools for using genotoxicty data to quantitatively evaluate the risk of tobacco products, we tested five carcinogens found in cigarette smoke, 4-aminobiphenyl (4-ABP), benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), cadmium (in the form of CdCl2), 2-amino-3,4-dimethyl-3H-imidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (MeIQ) and 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK), in the mouse lymphoma assay (MLA). The resulting mutagenicity dose responses were analyzed by various quantitative approaches and their strengths and weaknesses for distinguishing responses in the MLA were evaluated. L5178Y/Tk +/- 3.7.2C mouse lymphoma cells were treated with four to seven concentrations of each chemical for 4h. Only CdCl2 produced a positive response without metabolic activation (S9); all five chemicals produced dose-dependent increases in cytotoxicity and mutagenicity with S9. The lowest dose exceeding the global evaluation factor, the benchmark dose producing a 10%, 50%, 100% or 200% increase in the background frequency (BMD10, BMD50, BMD100 and BMD200), the no observed genotoxic effect level (NOGEL), the lowest observed genotoxic effect level (LOGEL) and the mutagenic potency expressed as a mutant frequency per micromole of chemical, were calculated for all the positive responses. All the quantitative metrics had similar rank orders for the agents' ability to induce mutation, from the most to least potent as CdCl2(-S9) > BaP(+S9) > CdCl2(+S9) > MeIQ(+S9) > 4-ABP(+S9) > NNK(+S9). However, the metric values for the different chemical responses (i.e. the ratio of the greatest value to the least value) for the different chemicals ranged from 16-fold (BMD10) to 572-fold (mutagenic potency). These results suggest that data from the MLA are capable of discriminating the mutagenicity of various constituents of cigarette smoke, and that quantitative analyses are available that can be useful in distinguishing between the exposure responses.",

Despite numerous efforts to intervene on this public health crisis, HIV infections continue to escalate, especially among young men. This condition is compounded by an ever-growing number of gay men who are aging and living with HIV. We must enact an innovative and proactive vision and framework for HIV prevention that moves us beyond the undertakings rooted in social-cognitive paradigms that have informed this work for the past 25 years. A new framework for HIV prevention must give voice to gay men; must consider the totality of their lives; must delineate the underlying logic, which directs their relation to sex and HIV; and must concurrently respect their diverse life experiences. This approach should be rooted in a biopsychosocial paradigm, should be informed by both theory and practice, and should be directed by three theoretical lenses--a theory of syndemics, developmental theories, and contextual understandings of HIV disease. Taken together, these elements are a call to action for research and practice psychologists who are working to improve the lives of gay men.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess trends in rates of hospitalization for nontraumatic lower-extremity amputation (NLEA) in U.S. diabetic and nondiabetic populations and disparities in NLEA rates within the diabetic population. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We calculated NLEA hospitalization rates, by diabetes status, among persons aged >/=40 years on the basis of National Hospital Discharge Survey data on NLEA procedures and National Health Interview Survey data on diabetes prevalence. We used joinpoint regression to calculate the annual percentage change (APC) and to assess trends in rates from 1988 to 2008. RESULTS: The age-adjusted NLEA discharge rate per 1,000 persons among those diagnosed with diabetes and aged >/=40 years decreased from 11.2 in 1996 to 3.9 in 2008 (APC -8.6%; P < 0.01), while rates among persons without diagnosed diabetes changed little. NLEA rates in the diabetic population decreased significantly from 1996 to 2008 in all demographic groups examined (all P < 0.05). Throughout the entire study period, rates of diabetes-related NLEA were higher among persons aged >/=75 years than among those who were younger, higher among men than women, and higher among blacks than whites. CONCLUSIONS: From 1996 to 2008, NLEA discharge rates declined significantly in the U.S. diabetic population. Nevertheless, NLEA continues to be substantially higher in the diabetic population than in the nondiabetic population and disproportionately affects people aged >/=75 years, blacks, and men. Continued efforts are needed to decrease the prevalence of NLEA risk factors and to improve foot care among certain subgroups within the U.S. diabetic population that are at higher risk.",

Samples were freeze-dried prior to analysis followed by neutron irradiation for 3 h at a fluence rate of 1 × 10^14 cm^−2 s^−1. After sample dissolution in perchloric and nitric acids, arsenic was separated from the matrix either by retention on hydrated manganese dioxide (urine) or by extraction into zinc diethyldithiocarbamate in chloroform (blood). ^76As was quantified by gamma-ray spectroscopy. Differences in chemical yield and counting geometry between samples and standards were monitored by measuring the count rate of a ^77As tracer added before sample dissolution. RNAA results were combined with inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry values from National Institute of Standards and Technology and collaborating laboratories to provide certified values of 10.81 ± 0.54 and 213.1 ± 0.73 μg/L for SRM 2668 Levels I and II, and certified values of 21.66 ± 0.73, 52.7 ± 1.1, and 78.8 ± 4.9 μg/L for SRM 955c Levels II–IV, respectively. Because of discrepancies between values obtained by different methods for SRM 955c Level I, an information value of <5 μg/L was assigned for this material.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Assessment of cancer incidence trends within the U.S. have mostly relied upon Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data, with implicit inference that such is representative of the general population. However, many cancer policy decisions are based at a more granular level. To help inform such, analyses of regional cancer incidence data are needed. Leveraging the unique resource of National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR)-SEER, we assessed whether regional rates and trends of esophageal cancer significantly deviated from national estimates. METHODS: From NPCR-SEER, we extracted cancer case counts and populations for whites aged 45-84 years by calendar year, histology, sex, and census region for the period 1999-2008. We calculated age-standardized incidence rates (ASRs), annual percent changes (APCs), and male-to-female incidence rate ratios (IRRs). RESULTS: This analysis included 65,823 esophageal adenocarcinomas and 27,094 esophageal squamous cell carcinomas diagnosed during 778 million person-years. We observed significant geographic variability in incidence rates and trends, especially for esophageal adenocarcinomas in males: ASRs were highest in the Northeast (17.7 per 100,000) and Midwest (18.1). Both were significantly higher than the national estimate (16.0). In addition, the Northeast APC was 62% higher than the national estimate (3.19% vs. 1.97%). Lastly, IRRs remained fairly constant across calendar time, despite changes in incidence rates. CONCLUSION: Significant regional variations in esophageal cancer incidence trends exist in the U.S. Stable IRRs may indicate the predominant factors affecting incidence rates are similar in men and women.",

This paper provides methods of statistical inference for the HAI and compares the available variance estimators for both the CI and the HAI using Monte Carlo simulation. Results for both the CI and the HAI suggest that analytical methods and bootstrapping are well behaved. The convenient regression method gives standard errors close to the other methods, provided the CI is not too large (< 0.2), but otherwise tends to understate the standard errors. In our simulation setting, the improvement from the Newey-West correction over the convenient regression method has mixed evidence when the CI </= 0.1 and is modest when the CI > 0.1. Published 2011.

        "abstract": "The objective of this study was to identify factors that may account for the disproportionately high prevalence of suicidal behaviors among Hispanic/Latina youth by examining whether associations of health risk behaviors with suicidal ideation and suicide attempts vary by race/ethnicity among female students. Data from the school-based 2007 national Youth Risk Behavior Survey were analyzed. Analyses were conducted among female students in grades 9 through 12 and included 21 risk behaviors related to unintentional injuries and violence; tobacco use; alcohol and other drug use; sexual behaviors that contribute to unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections, including human immunodeficiency virus; physical activity; obesity and weight control; and perceived health status. With the exception of physical activity behaviors and obesity, all risk behaviors examined were associated with suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. Associations of risk behaviors with suicidal ideation varied by race/ethnicity for 5 of 21 behaviors, and for 0 of 21 behaviors for suicide attempts. Stratified analyses provided little insight into factors that may account for the higher prevalence of suicidal behaviors among Hispanic/Latina female students. These results suggest that the increased risk of suicidal behaviors among Hispanic/Latina female students cannot be accounted for by differential associations with these selected risk behaviors. Other factors, such as family characteristics, acculturation, and the socio-cultural environment, should be examined in future research.",

        "abstract": "In addition to being a major nuisance biter, the lone star tick, Amblyomma americanum (L.), is increasingly recognized as an important vector of pathogens affecting humans, domestic animals, and wildlife. Despite its notoriety, efforts have been lacking to define the spatial occurrence ofA. americanum in the continental United States with precision beyond that conveyed in continental-scale distribution maps. Here we present a county-level distribution map for A. americanum generated by compiling collection records obtained from a search of the published literature and databases managed by the USDA, U.S. National Tick Collection, and Walter Reed Biosystematics Unit. Our decadal and cumulative maps, which visually summarize 18,121 collections made between 1898 and 2012, show that A. americanum is either established (> or = six ticks or -two life stages) or reported (<six ticks of a single life stage or number of ticks not specified) in 1,300 counties distributed among 39 states and the District of Columbia. Our cumulative map depicts a species with a core distributional area in the southern part of the eastern United States, but that also occurs further north, especially along the Atlantic Coast and into the Midwest. Although our decadal maps suggest a northward shift in the tick's distribution in recent decades, the lack of systematic tick surveillance makes this difficult to confirm. The data presented herein should aid in identifying areas posing risk for A. americanum-associated illnesses and environmental correlates that define the tick's distributional limits.",

        "abstract": "Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning is a leading cause of mine fire fatalities in underground mines. To reduce the hazard of CO poisoning in underground mines, it is important to accurately predict the spread of CO in underground mine entries when a fire occurs. This paper presents a study on modeling CO spread in underground mine fires using both the Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) and the MFIRE programs. The FDS model simulating part of the mine ventilation network was calibrated using CO concentration data from full-scale mine fire tests. The model was then used to investigate the effect of airflow leakage on CO concentration reduction in the mine entries. The inflow of fresh air at the leakage location was found to cause significant CO reduction. MFIRE simulation was conducted to predict the CO spread in the entire mine ventilation network using both a constant heat release rate and a dynamic fire source created from FDS. The results from both FDS and MFIRE simulations are compared and the implications of the improved MFIRE capability are discussed.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Population-based estimates of prevalence of anxiety and comorbid depression are lacking. Therefore, we estimated the prevalence and risk factors for postpartum anxiety and comorbid depressive symptoms in a population-based sample of women. METHODS: Using multinomial logistic regression, we examined the prevalence and risk factors for postpartum anxiety and depressive symptoms using 2009-2010 data from the Illinois and Maryland Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System, a population-based survey of mothers who gave birth to live infants. Survey participants are asked validated screening questions on anxiety and depressive symptoms. RESULTS: Among 4451 postpartum women, 18.0% reported postpartum anxiety symptoms, of whom 35% reported postpartum depressive symptoms (6.3% overall). In the multivariable model, higher numbers of stressors during pregnancy (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] range: 1.3-9.7) and delivering an infant at </=27 weeks gestation (aOR range: 2.0-5.7) were associated with postpartum anxiety and postpartum depressive symptoms, experienced individually or together. Smoking throughout pregnancy was associated with postpartum anxiety symptoms only (aOR=2.3) and comorbid anxiety and depressive symptoms (aOR=2.9). CONCLUSIONS: Given the possible adverse effects of postpartum anxiety and comorbid depression on maternal health and infant development, clinicians should be aware of the substantial prevalence, comorbidity, and risk factors for both conditions and facilitate identification, referral, and/or treatment.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cryptococcusgattii infections are being reported in the United States (US) with increasing frequency. Initially, US reports were primarily associated with an ongoing C. gattii outbreak in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) states of Washington and Oregon, starting in 2004. However, reports of C. gattii infections in patients from other US states have been increasing since 2009. Whether this is due to increasing frequency of disease, greater recognition within the clinical community, or both is currently unknown. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: During 2005-2013, a total of 273 C. gattii isolates from human and veterinary sources in 16 US states were collected. Of these, 214 (78%) were from the Pacific Northwest (PNW) and comprised primarily the clonal C. gattii genotypes VGIIa (64%), VGIIc (21%) and VGIIb (9%). The 59 isolates from outside the PNW were predominantly molecular types VGIII (44%) and VGI (41%). Genotyping using multilocus sequence typing revealed small clusters, including a cluster of VGI isolates from the southeastern US, and an unrelated cluster of VGI isolates and a large cluster of VGIII isolates from California. Most of the isolates were mating type MATalpha, including all of the VGII isolates, but one VGI and three VGIII isolates were mating type MATa. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We provide the most comprehensive report to date of genotypic diversity of US C. gattii isolates both inside and outside of the PNW. C. gattii may have multiple endemic regions in the US, including a previously-unrecognized endemic region in the southeast. Regional clusters exist both in California and the Southeastern US. VGII strains associated with the PNW outbreak do not appear to have spread substantially beyond the PNW.",

Host DNA from 37 bloodfed Culex coronator Dyar and Knab, 67 bloodfed Cx. salinarius Coquillett, 112 bloodfed Cx. nigripalpus Theobald, and 684 bloodfed Cx. quinquefasciatus Say were identified. The percentages of bloodmeals containing mammalian DNA were 94.6% for Cx. coronator, 82.1% for Cx. salinarius, 66.1% for Cx. nigripalpus, and 40.1% for Cx. quinquefasciatus. Human DNA was detected in 7% of the bloodmeals from Cx. quinquefasciatus and 2.7% of the bloodmeals from Cx. nigripalpus. The northern cardinal was the most frequent avian host of Cx. quinquefasciatus and Cx. nigripalpus. In 2003 and 2004, there was no significant relationship from May through October between the proportion of Cx. quinquefasciatus feeding on mammalian hosts and the date of collection. Of the six avian species most frequently fed on by Cx. quinquefasciatus, the northern cardinal, northern mockingbird, common grackle, and brown thrasher were fed on more frequently than expected based on their abundance. House sparrows were fed on less frequently than expected based on their abundance. These data support the conclusions of previous studies that Cx. quinquefasciatus is the most important vector for both the enzootic amplification and transmission of West Nile virus to humans in southern Louisiana.",

        "abstract": "Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is the leading cause of vaccine-preventable encephalitis in Asia and the western Pacific. JEV is maintained in an enzootic cycle involving mosquitoes and amplifying vertebrate hosts, mainly pigs and wading birds. The virus is transmitted to humans primarily by Culex mosquitoes, which breed in flooded rice fields and pools of stagnant water and most often feed outdoors during the evening and night. JEV transmission occurs mainly in rural agricultural areas, but occasional human cases occur in urban areas. Japanese encephalitis (JE) in persons who have traveled or lived overseas is diagnosed infrequently in the United States, with only four cases identified from 1992 (when a JE vaccine was first licensed in the United States) to 2008. This report describes the only cases diagnosed in the United States and reported to CDC since then. The first was a fatal case in a U.S. child who had visited relatives in the Philippines. The other occurred in a refugee who became ill while traveling from Thailand to the United States and whose diagnosis was complicated by concurrent neurocysticercosis. JE should be considered in the differential diagnosis for any patient with an acute neurologic infection who recently has been in a JE-endemic country. Travelers to JE-endemic countries should be advised of the risk for JE and the importance of personal protective measures to prevent mosquito bites. JE vaccine should be considered for travelers who might be at greater risk based on the season, location, and duration of their visit and their planned activities.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: We studied the transmission of rotavirus infection in households in peri-urban Ecuador in the vaccination era. METHODS: Stool samples were collected from household contacts of child rotavirus cases, diarrhea controls and healthy controls following presentation of the index child to health facilities. Rotavirus infection status of contacts was determined by RT-qPCR. We examined factors associated with transmissibility (index-case characteristics) and susceptibility (household-contact characteristics). RESULTS: Amongst cases, diarrhea controls and healthy control household contacts, infection attack rates (iAR) were 55%, 8% and 2%, (n = 137, 130, 137) respectively. iARs were higher from index cases with vomiting, and amongst siblings. Disease ARs were higher when the index child was <18 months and had vomiting, with household contact <10 years and those sharing a room with the index case being more susceptible. We found no evidence of asymptomatic infections leading to disease transmission. CONCLUSION: Transmission rates of rotavirus are high in households with an infected child, while background infections are rare. We have identified factors associated with transmission (vomiting/young age of index case) and susceptibility (young age/sharing a room/being a sibling of the index case). Vaccination may lead to indirect benefits by averting episodes or reducing symptoms in vaccinees.",

We examined factors associated with attending at least 2 clinic visits at least 90 days apart among HIV-infected, antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive HIV Outpatient Study participants entering care during 2000 to 2011. Of 1441 patients, 85% were retained in care during the first year of observation. Starting ART during the year was the strongest correlate of retention (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 6.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.4-9.4). After adjusting for starting ART, publicly insured patients (aOR 0.6, 95% CI 0.4-1.0), and patients with baseline CD4 counts <200 cells/mm(3) (aOR 0.5, 95% CI 0.3-0.9) or missing CD4 counts (aOR 0.3, 95% CI 0.2-0.6) were less likely to be retained in care. Although most patients had recommended biannual care visits, some ART-naive individuals may require additional interventions to remain in care. Promptly initiating ART may facilitate engagement in care.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: An epidemic of acute gastroenteritis occurred in Rio Branco City, Acre State, in Brazil's Amazon region in 2005. An investigation was conducted to confirm the etiology and identify possible risk factors for death. METHODS: Rio Branco municipality surveillance data for the period May to October 2005 were reviewed. In a case-control study, children who died following acute gastroenteritis were compared to age-matched controls with acute gastroenteritis who survived. Rotavirus A (RV-A) was investigated in 799 stool samples and genotyped by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: The cumulative incidence of diarrhea in children aged <5 years was 21%. A fatal outcome was significantly associated with uncovered household water storage containers. RV-A was identified in 88% of samples and G9 was the prevalent genotype (71%). CONCLUSIONS: Oral rehydration solution and boiling or chlorinating drinking water likely limited mortality. This epidemic was caused by RV-A genotype G9. After the outbreak, a rotavirus vaccine was introduced into the official childhood immunization schedule in Brazil.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Immunization policymakers at global and local levels need to establish priorities among new vaccines competing for limited resources. However, comparison of the potential impact of single vaccination programs is challenging, primarily due to the limited number of vaccine analyses as well as their differing analytic approaches and reporting formats. The purpose of this study is to provide early insight into how the comparative impact of different new vaccines could be assessed in resource-poor settings with respect to affordability, cost-effectiveness, and distributional equity. METHODS: We compared the health, economic, and financial consequences of introducing the two vaccines in 72 GAVI-eligible countries using a number of different outcome measures to evaluate affordability, cost-effectiveness, and distributional equity. We use simple static models to standardize the analytic framework and improve comparability between the two new vaccines. These simple models were validated by leveraging previously developed, more complex models for rotavirus and human papillomavirus (HPV). RESULTS: With 70% coverage of a single-age cohort of infants and pre-adolescent girls, the lives saved with rotavirus (~274,000) and HPV vaccines (~286,000) are similar, although the timing of averted mortality differs; rotavirus-attributable deaths occur in close proximity to infection, while HPV-related cancer deaths occur largely after age 30. Deaths averted per 1000 vaccinated are 5.2 (rotavirus) and 12.6 (HPV). Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted were ~7.15 million (rotavirus) and ~1.30 million (HPV), reflecting the greater influence of discounting on the latter, given the lagtime between vaccination and averted cancer. In most countries (68 for rotavirus and 66 for HPV, at the cost of I$25 per vaccinated individual) the incremental cost per DALY averted was lower than each country's GDP per capita. Financial resources required for vaccination with rotavirus are higher than with HPV since both genders are vaccinated. CONCLUSIONS: While lifesaving benefits of rotavirus and HPV vaccines will be realized at different times, the number of lives saved over each target populations' lifetimes will be similar. Model-based analyses that use a standardized analytic approach and generate comparable outputs can enrich the priority-setting dialogue. Although new vaccines may be deemed cost-effective, other factors including affordability and distributional equity need to be considered in different settings. We caution that for priority setting in an individual country, more rigorous comparisons should be performed, using more comprehensive models and considering all relevant vaccines and delivery strategies.",

        "abstract": "A motivational orientation intervention designed to improve parenting program retention was field tested versus standard orientation across two parenting programs, Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT) and a standard didactic parent training group. Both interventions were implemented within a frontline child welfare parenting center by center staff. Participants had an average of six prior child welfare referrals, primarily for neglect. A double-randomized design was used to test main and interaction effects. The motivational intervention improved retention only when combined with PCIT (cumulative survival = 85% vs. around 61% for the three other design cells). Benefits were robust across demographic characteristics and participation barriers but were concentrated among participants whose initial level of motivation was low to moderate. There were negative effects for participants with relatively high initial motivation. The findings suggest that using a motivational intervention combined with PCIT can improve retention when used selectively with relatively low to moderately motivated child welfare clients.",

        "abstract": "The history and epidemiology of human leptospirosis in Malaysia from 1925 to 2012 are described. Previous studies have demonstrated that leptospirosis is an endemic disease in Malaysia occurring in both urban and rural locations. The number of cases has risen dramatically since the Ministry of Health Malaysia highlighted leptospirosis as a notifiable disease in 2010, with reported cases increasing from 248 cases in 2004 to 3604 in 2012. The incidence of infection among the population suggests that occupation, sex, age, ethnic background, water recreational activities, and sporting events are risk factors. A robust surveillance system is now in place to monitor temporal and spatial changes in the incidence and prevalence of infection and to identify risk areas and disease behavior. Despite extensive studies over the past decade, there is a still a need to describe local serovars in host carriers and the human population, with the view to develop an effective vaccine against leptospirosis.",

Adolescents' self-rated health and reported mental health declined significantly, especially among those in low-income families, but their physical health and activity limitation did not change. Because these HRQOL declines occurred at the end of the decade and especially among adolescents from low-income families, we conclude that these declines are consistent with recession effects and warrant further study.",

METHODS: To assess differences between survivor characteristics in 1992 and 2010, we conducted descriptive analyses of 1992 and 2010 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) data. Our study sample consisted of 1018 self-reported cancer survivors from the 1992 NHIS and 1718 self-reported cancer survivors from the 2010 NHIS who completed the Cancer Control (CCS) and Cancer Epidemiology (CES) Supplements. RESULTS: The prevalence of reported survivors increased from 1992 to 2010 (4.2% versus 6.3%). From 1992 to 2010, there was an increase in long-term cancer survivors and a drop in multiple malignancies, and surgery remained the most widely used treatment. Significantly fewer survivors (<10 years after diagnosis) were denied insurance coverage. Survivors continue to report low participation in counseling or support groups. CONCLUSIONS: As the prevalence of cancer survivors continues to grow, monitoring differences in survivor characteristics can be useful in evaluating the effects of policy recommendations and the quality of clinical care.",

        "abstract": "CONTEXT: Use of Immunization information systems (IISs) by providers can improve vaccination rates by identifying missed opportunities. However, provider reporting of children's vaccination histories to IISs remains suboptimal. OBJECTIVE: To assess factors associated with provider reporting to an IIS. DESIGN: Analysis of 2006-2012 National Immunization Survey (NIS) and NIS-Teen data. NIS and NIS-Teen are ongoing random-digit-dial telephone surveys of households with children and adolescents, respectively, followed by a mail survey to providers to obtain the patient's vaccination history. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 115 285 children aged 19 to 35 months and 83 612 adolescents aged 13 to 17 years and their immunization providers in the United States. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The percentage of children and adolescents with 1 or more providers reporting to or obtaining vaccination information from their local IISs. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine patient and provider factors associated with provider reporting to IISs and adjusted prevalence of children and adolescents with 1 or more providers reporting to IISs. RESULTS: In 2012, 79.4% of children and 77.4% of adolescents had 1 or more providers report any of their vaccination data to an IIS, and 41.9% of children and 51.5% of adolescents had providers who obtained any of their vaccination histories from an IIS. During 2006-2012, children and adolescents were more likely to have any of their vaccination data reported to an IIS if they received care from all public versus all private providers (children: 84.4% vs 69.6%, P < .0001; adolescents: 84.6% vs 66.4%, P < .0001), had 1 or more providers who ordered vaccines from a state or local health department (children: 76.7% vs 59.5%, P < .0001; adolescents: 77.0% vs 55.6%, P < .0001), or had 1 or more providers obtain vaccination information from the IIS (children: 86.1% vs 71.2%, P < .0001; adolescents: 83.7% vs 64.6%, P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: Health department staff should target providers less likely to use IIS services, including private providers, and providers not ordering vaccines from health departments to ensure they use IIS services.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Cerebral palsy (CP) and intellectual disability (ID) are developmental disabilities that result in considerable functional limitations. There are few recent and nationally representative prevalence estimates of CP and ID in the United States. METHODS: We used two U.S. nationally representative surveys, the 2011-2012 National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH) and the 2011-2013 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), to determine the prevalence of CP and ID based on parent report among children aged 2-17 years. RESULTS: CP prevalence was 2.6 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.1-3.2) per 1000 in the NSCH and 2.9 (95% CI: 2.3-3.7) in the NHIS. ID prevalence was 12.2 (95% CI: 10.7-13.9) and 12.1 (95% CI: 10.8-13.7) in NSCH and NHIS, respectively. For both conditions, the NSCH and NHIS prevalence estimates were similar to each other for nearly all sociodemographic subgroups examined. CONCLUSIONS: Despite using different modes of data collection, the two surveys produced similar and plausible estimates of CP and ID and offer opportunities to better understand the needs and situations of children with these conditions.",

        "abstract": "Professional development, including training and leadership skill building, is important for maternal and child health (MCH) epidemiologists. Current workforce development and training opportunities vary, but lack an emphasis on linking leadership competencies with MCH epidemiology. This paper describes efforts at the annual MCH Epidemiology Conference (the \"Conference\") to promote leadership activities and workforce development, and recommendations to enhance professional development. An evaluation of attendee opinions on Conference workforce development activities was conducted during the 2009 and 2010 Conferences (70 and 66 % response rates, respectively). Frequencies and percentages were calculated overall and by attendee profession. Qualitative responses to questions regarding workforce and professional development were classified by theme in 2009, and a categorical question was developed for the 2010 evaluation. A combined 38 % of Conference attendees in 2009 and 2010 were MCH epidemiologists and 62 % were other MCH professionals. Attendees recommended more support and access to training, mentoring, and resources including job opportunities. Continuing education (41 %), special knowledge and skills-building training (51 %), and development of online resources for training (57 %) were highly recommended by attendees. Career (47 %) and leadership (49 %) mentoring by senior-level professionals in the field were also highly recommended. Promotion of leadership can be achieved by integrating the concept of leadership into the Conference itself; by publishing and disseminating MCH epidemiologic research in scientific, program, and policy settings; and by communicating the importance of epidemiologic findings to stakeholders and other non-scientific audiences.",

        "abstract": "The southeastern US sustains the highest high school dropout rates, and gangs persist in underserved communities. African American female adolescents who drop out of school and are gang members are at substantial risk of exposure to severe violence, physical abuse, and sexual exploitation. In this study of 237 female African American adolescents 16-19 years of age from North Carolina who dropped out or considered dropping out, 11% were current or past gang members. Adolescents who reported gang membership began smoking marijuana at a mean age of 13, whereas those who reported no gang membership began at a mean age of 15 years (P<0.001). The mean ages of first alcohol use were 14 years and 15 years for gang members and non-gang members, respectively (P=0.04). Problem alcohol use was high in both groups: 40% and 65% for non-gang and gang members, respectively (P=0.02). Controlling for frequent marijuana use and problem alcohol use, adolescents who reported gang membership were more likely than non-gang members to experience sexual abuse (odds ratio [OR] =2.60, 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.06, 6.40]), experience physical abuse (OR =7.33, 95% CI [2.90, 18.5]), report emotional abuse from their main partner (OR =3.55, 95% CI [1.44, 8.72]), run away from home (OR =4.65, 95% CI [1.90, 11.4]), get arrested (OR =2.61, 95% CI [1.05, 6.47]), and report violence in their neighborhood including murder (OR =3.27, 95% CI [1.35, 7.96]) and fights with weapons (OR =3.06, 95% CI [1.15, 8.11]). Gang members were less likely to receive emotional support (OR =0.89, 95% CI [0.81, 0.97]). These findings reinforce the urgent need to reach young African American women in disadvantaged communities affiliated with gangs to address the complexity of context and interconnected risk behaviors.",

Febrile patients meeting a clinical case definition were enrolled from inpatient and outpatient medicine and pediatric units. We assessed 720 febrile patients over 12 months; 69 (9.6%) were positive for IgM antibodies against dengue virus by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and four malaria patients (0.56%) were confirmed with immuno-chromatography and microscopic slide tests. We identified dengue cases throughout the year from rural (49%) and urban areas (51%). We followed-up 55 accessible dengue-infected patients two months after their initial enrollment: 45 (82%) patients had fully recovered, 9 (16%) reported ongoing jaundice, fever and/or joint pain, and one died. Dengue infection is widespread across Bangladesh, but malaria is sufficiently uncommon that it should not be assumed as the cause of fever without laboratory confirmation.",

        "abstract": "RATIONALE: Drug-resistant tuberculosis transmission in hospitals threatens staff and patient health. Surgical face masks used by patients with tuberculosis (TB) are believed to reduce transmission but have not been rigorously tested. OBJECTIVES: We sought to quantify the efficacy of surgical face masks when worn by patients with multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). METHODS: Over 3 months, 17 patients with pulmonary MDR-TB occupied an MDR-TB ward in South Africa and wore face masks on alternate days. Ward air was exhausted to two identical chambers, each housing 90 pathogen-free guinea pigs that breathed ward air either when patients wore surgical face masks (intervention group) or when patients did not wear masks (control group). Efficacy was based on differences in guinea pig infections in each chamber. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Sixty-nine of 90 control guinea pigs (76.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 68-85%) became infected, compared with 36 of 90 intervention guinea pigs (40%; 95% CI, 31-51%), representing a 56% (95% CI, 33-70.5%) decreased risk of TB transmission when patients used masks. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical face masks on patients with MDR-TB significantly reduced transmission and offer an adjunct measure for reducing TB transmission from infectious patients.",

        "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends the tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine for pregnant women during each pregnancy, regardless of prior immunization status. However, safety data on repeated Tdap vaccination in pregnancy is lacking. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether receipt of Tdap vaccine during pregnancy administered in close intervals from prior tetanus-containing vaccinations is associated with acute adverse events in mothers and adverse birth outcomes in neonates. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective cohort study in 29,155 pregnant women aged 14 through 49 years from January 1, 2007, through November 15, 2013, using data from 7 Vaccine Safety Datalink sites in California, Colorado, Minnesota, Oregon, Washington, and Wisconsin. EXPOSURES: Women who received Tdap in pregnancy following a prior tetanus-containing vaccine less than 2 years before, 2 to 5 years before, and more than 5 years before. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Acute adverse events (fever, allergy, and local reactions) and adverse birth outcomes (small for gestational age, preterm delivery, and low birth weight) were evaluated. Women who were vaccinated with Tdap in pregnancy and had a prior tetanus-containing vaccine more than 5 years before served as controls. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences in rates of medically attended acute adverse events or adverse birth outcomes related to timing since prior tetanus-containing vaccination. [table: see text]. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among women who received Tdap vaccination during pregnancy, there was no increased risk of acute adverse events or adverse birth outcomes for those who had been previously vaccinated less than 2 years before or 2 to 5 years before compared with those who had been vaccinated more than 5 years before. These findings suggest that relatively recent receipt of a prior tetanus-containing vaccination does not increase risk after Tdap vaccination in pregnancy.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: A chlorine gas release occurred at a poultry processing plant as a result of an accidental mixing of sodium hypochlorite and an acidic antimicrobial treatment. We evaluated the public health and emergency medical services response and developed and disseminated public health recommendations to limit the impact of future incidents. METHODS: We conducted key informant interviews with the state health department; local fire, emergency medical services, and police departments; county emergency management; and representatives from area hospitals to understand the response mechanisms employed for this incident. RESULTS: After being exposed to an estimated 40-pound chlorine gas release, 170 workers were triaged on the scene and sent to 5 area hospitals. Each hospital redistributed staff or called in extra staff (eg, physicians, nurses, and respiratory therapists) in response to the event. Interviews with hospital staff emphasized the need for improved communication with responders at the scene of a chemical incident. CONCLUSIONS: While responding, hospitals handled the patient surge without outside assistance because of effective planning, training, and drilling. The investigation highlighted that greater interagency communication can play an important role in ensuring that chemical incident patients are managed and treated in a timely manner.",

        "abstract": "School-located vaccination against influenza (SLV-I) has been suggested to help meet the need for annual vaccination of large numbers of school-aged children with seasonal influenza vaccine. However, little is known about the cost and cost-effectiveness of SLV-I. We conducted a cost-analysis and a cost-effectiveness analysis based on a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of an SLV-I program implemented in Monroe County, New York during the 2009-2010 vaccination season. We hypothesized that SLV-I is more cost effective, or less-costly, compared to a conventional, office-located influenza vaccination delivery. First and second SLV-I clinics were offered in 21 intervention elementary schools (n=9027 children) with standard of care (no SLV-I) in 11 control schools (n=4534 children). The direct costs, to purchase and administer vaccines, were estimated from our RCT. The effectiveness measure, receipt of >/=1 dose of influenza vaccine, was 13.2 percentage points higher in SLV-I schools than control schools. The school costs ($9.16/dose in 2009 dollars) plus project costs ($23.00/dose) plus vendor costs excluding vaccine purchase ($19.89/dose) was higher in direct costs ($52.05/dose) than the previously reported mean/median cost [$38.23/$21.44 per dose] for providing influenza vaccination in pediatric practices. However SLV-I averted parent costs to visit medical practices ($35.08 per vaccine). Combining direct and averted costs through Monte Carlo Simulation, SLV-I costs were $19.26/dose in net costs, which is below practice-based influenza vaccination costs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was estimated to be $92.50 or $38.59 (also including averted parent costs). When additionally accounting for the costs averted by disease prevention (i.e., both reduced disease transmission to household members and reduced loss of productivity from caring for a sick child), the SLV-I model appears to be cost-saving to society, compared to \"no vaccination\". Our findings support the expanded implementation of SLV-I, but also the need to focus on efficient delivery to reduce direct costs.",

METHODS: This cross-sectional study utilized data extracted from the Ontario Workplace Safety and Insurance Board (WSIB) records indicating concussion/intracranial injury that resulted in days off work in 2004-2005. RESULTS: Analyses of 218 TBI cases revealed that falls were the most common cause of injury, followed by being struck by or against an object. Mechanisms of injury and the temporal profile of injury also varied by age. For instance, a significantly higher proportion of injuries occurred in the mornings for young workers compared to older workers. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study provide important information for prevention of TBI which suggest important age-specific strategies for workers in the construction industry.",

        "abstract": "When the antecedents of health-promoting behavior are explored, the concept of health literacy is deemed a factor of major influence. Originally defined as reading, writing and numeracy skills in the health domain, health literacy is now considered a multidimensional concept. The ongoing discussion on health literacy reveals that no agreement exists about which dimensions to include in the concept. To contribute to the development of a consistent and parsimonious concept of health literacy, we conducted a critical review of concepts in other literacy domains. Our review was guided by two research questions: (i) Which dimensions are included in the concepts of other literacy domains? (ii) How can health literacy research profit from other literacy domains? Based on articles collected from PubMed, PsycINFO, Communication & Mass Media Complete, CINAHL, SAGE Full-Text Collection, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar as well as selected monographs and editions, we identified seven distinct dimensions. Some of the dimensions recur across all reviewed literacy domains and first attempts have been made to operationalize the dimensions. Expanding upon these dimensions, the paper discusses how they can prove useful for elaborating a consistent and parsimonious concept of health literacy and foster the development of a more holistic measure.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of maternal prenatal smokeless tobacco use on infant birth size. DESIGN: A retrospective medical record review of 502 randomly selected deliveries. POPULATION: Singleton deliveries to Alaska Native women residing in a defined geographical region in western Alaska, 1997-2005. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A regional medical center's electronic records were used to identify singleton deliveries. Data on maternal tobacco exposure and pregnancy outcomes were abstracted from medical records. Logistic models were used to estimate adjusted mean birthweight, length, and head circumference for deliveries to women who used no tobacco (n=121), used smokeless tobacco (n=237), or smoked cigarettes (n=59). Differences in mean birthweight, length, and head circumference, 95% confidence intervals, and p-values were calculated using non-users as the reference group. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Infant birthweight, crown-heel length, and head circumference. RESULTS: After adjustment for gestational age and other potential confounders, the mean birthweight of infants of smokeless tobacco users was reduced by 78g compared with that of infants of non-users (p=0.18), and by 331g in infants of smokers (p<0.01). No association was found between maternal smokeless tobacco use and infant length or infant head circumference. CONCLUSIONS: We found a modest but non-significant reduction in the birthweight of infants of smokeless tobacco users compared with infants of tobacco non-users. Because smokeless tobacco contains many toxic compounds that could affect other pregnancy outcomes, results of this study should not be construed to mean that smokeless tobacco use is safe during pregnancy.",

        "abstract": "Genetic prediction of common diseases is based on testing multiple genetic variants with weak effect sizes. Standard logistic regression and Cox Proportional Hazard models that assess the combined effect of multiple variants on disease risk assume multiplicative joint effects of the variants, but this assumption may not be correct. The risk model chosen may affect the predictive accuracy of genomic profiling. We investigated the discriminative accuracy of genomic profiling by comparing additive and multiplicative risk models. We examined genomic profiles of 40 variants with genotype frequencies varying from 0.1 to 0.4 and relative risks varying from 1.1 to 1.5 in separate scenarios assuming a disease risk of 10%. The discriminative accuracy was evaluated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Predicted risks were more extreme at the lower and higher risks for the multiplicative risk model compared with the additive model. The discriminative accuracy was consistently higher for multiplicative risk models than for additive risk models. The differences in discriminative accuracy were negligible when the effect sizes were small (<1.2), but were substantial when risk genotypes were common or when they had stronger effects. Unraveling the exact mode of biological interaction is important when effect sizes of genetic variants are moderate at the least, to prevent the incorrect estimation of risks.

        "abstract": "On December 13, 2014, the emergency management system in Lake Delton, Wisconsin, was notified when a male hockey player aged 20 years lost consciousness after participation in an indoor hockey tournament that included approximately 50 hockey players and 100 other attendees. Elevated levels of carbon monoxide (CO) (range = 45 ppm-165 ppm) were detected by the fire department inside the arena. The emergency management system encouraged all players and attendees to seek medical evaluation for possible CO poisoning. The Wisconsin Department of Health Services (WDHS) conducted an epidemiologic investigation to determine what caused the exposure and to recommend preventive strategies. Investigators abstracted medical records from area emergency departments (EDs) for patients who sought care for CO exposure during December 13-14, 2014, conducted a follow-up survey of ED patients approximately 2 months after the event, and conducted informant interviews. Ninety-two persons sought ED evaluation for possible CO exposure, all of whom were tested for CO poisoning. Seventy-four (80%) patients had blood carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) levels consistent with CO poisoning (1); 32 (43%) CO poisoning cases were among hockey players. On December 15, the CO emissions from the propane-fueled ice resurfacer were demonstrated to be 4.8% of total emissions when actively resurfacing and 2.3% when idling, both above the optimal range of 0.5%-1.0% (2,3). Incomplete fuel combustion by the ice resurfacer was the most likely source of elevated CO. CO poisonings in ice arenas can be prevented through regular maintenance of ice resurfacers, installation of CO detectors, and provision of adequate ventilation.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite annual co-circulation of different subtypes of seasonal influenza, co-infections between different viruses are rarely detected. These co-infections can result in the emergence of reassortant progeny. STUDY DESIGN: We document the detection of an influenza co-infection, between influenza A/H3N2 with A/H1N1pdm09 viruses, which occurred in a 3 year old male in Cambodia during April 2014. Both viruses were detected in the patient at relatively high viral loads (as determined by real-time RT-PCR CT values), which is unusual for influenza co-infections. As reassortment can occur between co-infected influenza A strains we isolated plaque purified clonal viral populations from the clinical material of the patient infected with A/H3N2 and A/H1N1pdm09. RESULTS: Complete genome sequences were completed for 7 clonal viruses to determine if any reassorted viruses were generated during the influenza virus co-infection. Although most of the viral sequences were consistent with wild-type A/H3N2 or A/H1N1pdm09, one reassortant A/H3N2 virus was isolated which contained an A/H1N1pdm09 NS1 gene fragment. The reassortant virus was viable and able to infect cells, as judged by successful passage in MDCK cells, achieving a TCID50 of 104/ml at passage number two. There is no evidence that the reassortant virus was transmitted further. The co-infection occurred during a period when co-circulation of A/H3N2 and A/H1N1pdm09 was detected in Cambodia. CONCLUSIONS: It is unclear how often influenza co-infections occur, but laboratories should consider influenza co-infections during routine surveillance activities.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The treatment of persons living with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune-deficiency syndrome (PLWHAs) for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) reduces tuberculosis (TB) morbidity. Despite a high TB burden and an expanding human immunodeficiency virus epidemic, Russia had limited data on the utility of the tuberculin skin test (TST) for LTBI diagnosis in PLWHAs. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence and predictors of positive TSTs in PLWHAs in Orel Oblast. METHODS: A total of 150 consenting PLWHAs being followed up at the AIDS Center were administered a TST and a questionnaire for risk factors for LTBI. A positive TST result was defined as >or=5 mm induration. RESULTS: Of the 150 subjects, 67% were male and 74% were aged <30 years. Of the PLWHAs tested, 26% had a positive TST result, while among PLWHAs with CD4(+) >500 cells/ml, 36% were TST-positive. TST positivity varied inversely with CD4(+) cell count. Among PLWHAs with a history of injection drug use, the primary risk factor for HIV, 29 (31.9%) were positive. CONCLUSIONS: A high proportion of tested PLWHAs had a positive TST and could benefit from preventive therapy (PT) to reduce the risk of TB. A TB control programme in Russia should therefore include TST screening among PLWHAs and PT, besides active TB case finding and treatment.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Streptococcus pneumoniae is a leading cause of bacterial pneumonia, meningitis, and sepsis in children worldwide. However, many countries lack national estimates of disease burden. Effective interventions are available, including pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and case management. To support local and global policy decisions on pneumococcal disease prevention and treatment, we estimated country-specific incidence of serious cases and deaths in children younger than 5 years. METHODS: We measured the burden of pneumococcal pneumonia by applying the proportion of pneumonia cases caused by S pneumoniae derived from efficacy estimates from vaccine trials to WHO country-specific estimates of all-cause pneumonia cases and deaths. We also estimated burden of meningitis and non-pneumonia, non-meningitis invasive disease using disease incidence and case-fatality data from a systematic literature review. When high-quality data were available from a country, these were used for national estimates. Otherwise, estimates were based on data from neighbouring countries with similar child mortality. Estimates were adjusted for HIV prevalence and access to care and, when applicable, use of vaccine against Haemophilus influenzae type b. FINDINGS: In 2000, about 14·5 million episodes of serious pneumococcal disease (uncertainty range 11·1–18·0 million) were estimated to occur. Pneumococcal disease caused about 826 000 deaths (582 000–926 000) in children aged 1–59 months, of which 91 000 (63 000–102 000) were in HIV-positive and 735 000 (519 000–825 000) in HIV-negative children. Of the deaths in HIV-negative children, over 61% (449 000 [316 000–501 000]) occurred in ten African and Asian countries. INTERPRETATION: S pneumoniae causes around 11% (8–12%) of all deaths in children aged 1–59 months (excluding pneumococcal deaths in HIV-positive children). Achievement of the UN Millennium Development Goal 4 for child mortality reduction can be accelerated by prevention and treatment of pneumococcal disease, especially in regions of the world with the greatest burden.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: We explored the contribution of missed primary HIV care visits (\"no-show\") to observed disparities in virological failure (VF) among Black persons and persons with injection drug use (IDU) history. METHODS:  We used patient-level data from 6 academic clinics, before the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Health Resources and Services Administration Retention in Care intervention. We employed staged multivariable logistic regression and multivariable models stratified by no-show visit frequency to evaluate the association of sociodemographic factors with VF. We used multiple imputations to assign missing viral load values. RESULTS:  Among 10 053 patients (mean age = 46 years; 35% female; 64% Black; 15% with IDU history), 31% experienced VF. Although Black patients and patients with IDU history were significantly more likely to experience VF in initial analyses, race and IDU parameter estimates were attenuated after sequential addition of no-show frequency. In stratified models, race and IDU were not statistically significantly associated with VF at any no-show level. CONCLUSIONS: Because missed clinic visits contributed to observed differences in viral load outcomes among Black and IDU patients, achieving an improved understanding of differential visit attendance is imperative to reducing disparities in HIV.",

        "abstract": "Acanthamoeba is the most common cause of granulomatous amebic encephalitis, a typically fatal condition that is classically described as indolent and slowly progressive. We report a case of Acanthamoeba encephalitis in a kidney transplant recipient that progressed to death within 3 days of symptom onset and was diagnosed at autopsy. We also review clinical characteristics, treatments, and outcomes of all published cases of Acanthamoeba encephalitis in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients. Ten cases were identified, and the infection was fatal in 9 of these cases. In 6 patients, Acanthamoeba presented in a fulminant manner and death occurred within 2 weeks after the onset of neurologic symptoms. These acute presentations are likely related to immunodeficiencies associated with solid organ transplantation that result in an inability to control Acanthamoeba proliferation. Skin lesions may predate neurologic involvement and provide an opportunity for early diagnosis and treatment. Acanthamoeba is an under-recognized cause of encephalitis in SOT recipients and often presents in a fulminant manner in this population. Increased awareness of this disease and its clinical manifestations is essential to attain an early diagnosis and provide the best chance of cure.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alcohol-impaired driving crashes account for nearly 11,000 crash fatalities, or about one third of all crash fatalities in the United States. METHODS: CDC analyzed data from the 2010 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey to obtain the prevalence, episodes, and rates of alcohol-impaired driving (defined as driving \"when you've had perhaps too much to drink\" in the past 30 days) among U.S. adults aged >/=18 years who responded to the survey by landline telephone. RESULTS: In 2010, an estimated 4 million U.S. adult respondents reported at least one episode of alcohol-impaired driving, for an estimated total of approximately 112 million alcohol-impaired driving episodes or 479 episodes per 1,000 adult population. From a peak in 2006, such episodes decreased 30% through 2010. Men accounted for 81% of all episodes with young men aged 21--34 years accounting for 32% of all episodes. Additionally, 85% of alcohol-impaired driving episodes were reported by persons who also reported binge drinking, and the 4.5% of the adult population who reported binge drinking at least four times per month accounted for 55% of all alcohol-impaired driving episodes. Episode rates were nearly four times higher among persons who reported not always wearing seatbelts compared with persons who reported always wearing seatbelts. CONCLUSIONS: Rates of self-reported alcohol-impaired driving have declined substantially in recent years. However, rates remain disproportionally high among young men, binge drinkers, and those who do not always wear a seat belt. IMPLICATIONS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH: States and communities should continue current evidence-based strategies, such as sobriety checkpoints and enforcement of 0.08 g/dL blood alcohol concentration laws to deter the public from driving while impaired. Additionally, all states should consider requiring ignition interlocks on the vehicles of all persons convicted of alcohol-impaired driving. States without primary seatbelt laws should consider enacting them to reduce fatalities in alcohol-impaired driving crashes.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To delineate the risk factors, symptom patterns, and longitudinal course of prolonged illnesses after a variety of acute infections. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study following patients from the time of acute infection with Epstein-Barr virus (glandular fever), Coxiella burnetii (Q fever), or Ross River virus (epidemic polyarthritis). SETTING: The region surrounding the township of Dubbo in rural Australia, encompassing a 200 km geographical radius and 104,400 residents. PARTICIPANTS: 253 patients enrolled and followed at regular intervals over 12 months by self report, structured interview, and clinical assessment. OUTCOME MEASURES: Detailed medical, psychiatric, and laboratory evaluations at six months to apply diagnostic criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome. Premorbid and intercurrent illness characteristics recorded to define risk factors for chronic fatigue syndrome. Self reported illness phenotypes compared between infective groups. RESULTS: Prolonged illness characterised by disabling fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, neurocognitive difficulties, and mood disturbance was evident in 29 (12%) of 253 participants at six months, of whom 28 (11%) met the diagnostic criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome. This post-infective fatigue syndrome phenotype was stereotyped and occurred at a similar incidence after each infection. The syndrome was predicted largely by the severity of the acute illness rather than by demographic, psychological, or microbiological factors. CONCLUSIONS: A relatively uniform post-infective fatigue syndrome persists in a significant minority of patients for six months or more after clinical infection with several different viral and non-viral micro-organisms. Post-infective fatigue syndrome is a valid illness model for investigating one pathophysiological pathway to chronic fatigue syndrome.",

        "abstract": "Several magnetic proximity detection systems have been developed for mining vehicles and mobile machinery to protect nearby workers. Magnetic field generators are often used in these systems to establish magnetic fields around the equipment. A sensor worn by a worker provides a measurement of the magnetic flux density that is used to estimate the proximity to the machine. The proximity detection systems currently available for underground mining equipment are capable of identifying whether a worker is near the machine. However, it is a challenge for these systems to accurately locate the worker. Mining machines, which have fast-moving, articulated parts, present hazards that change depending on the situation at hand as well as the specific location of the worker. In addition, the dynamic nature and confined spaces of the mining environment often demand that the workers be close to the machinery. Therefore, in many cases, simply knowing the proximity of a worker may be inadequate. To provide the most effective protection, it would be advantageous to know the worker's exact location relative to specific parts of the machine. To lay the foundation for measuring such a location, we have developed a shell-based model of the magnetic flux density distribution for a ferrite-cored generator. This paper will present an analysis of the model along with a model construction process. Also presented are the laboratory test results of a prototype system that implements this model to determine the exact location of a magnetic sensor using the fields from two generators.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Confirmation of cure for multidrugresistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patients requires laboratory tests for Mycobacterium tuberculosis growth on culture media. Outcome decisions dictate patient management, and inaccuracies place patients at an increased risk of morbidity and mortality, and may contribute to continued transmission of MDR-TB. OBJECTIVE: To examine concordance between programmatic and laboratory-based MDR-TB treatment outcomes. METHODS: The study population included 1658 MDRTB patients in Peru treated between 1996 and 2002 with both program and laboratory-based outcomes. Laboratory-based outcomes were assigned according to international standards requiring at least five consecutive negative cultures in the last 12 months of treatment to confirm cure. RESULTS: Compared to the global culture-defined standard classification, only 1.1% of treatment successes, but 54.3% of failures, were misclassified programmatically. Overall, 10.4% of patients identified by a clinician as having a successful treatment outcome still had cultures positive for MDR-TB. CONCLUSION: Most patients with successful treatment outcomes by strict culture definitions were also classified by clinicians as having successful outcomes. However, many culture-confirmed failures were missed. In light of delays and incomplete access to culture in MDR-TB programs, efforts should be made to improve the accuracy of programmatically determined treatment outcomes. (2012 The Union.)",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In response to inconsistent findings, we investigated associations between maternal serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations and infant birthweight for gestational age (BW/GA), including potential effect modification by maternal race/ethnicity and infant sex. METHODS: Data from 2558 pregnant women were combined in a nested case-control study (preterm and term) sampled from three cohorts: the Omega study, the Pregnancy, Infection and Nutrition study, and the Pregnancy Outcomes and Community Health study. Maternal 25(OH)D concentrations were sampled at 4 to 29 weeks gestation (80% 14-26 weeks). BW/GA was modelled as sex and gestational age-specific birthweight z-scores. General linear regression models (adjusting for age, education, parity, pre-pregnancy body mass index, season at blood draw, and smoking) assessed 25(OH)D concentrations in relation to BW/GA. RESULTS: Among non-Hispanic Black women, the positive association between 25(OH)D concentrations and BW/GA was of similar magnitude in pregnancies with female or male infants [beta (beta) = 0.015, standard error (SE) = 0.007, P = 0.025; beta = 0.018, SE = 0.006, P = 0.003, respectively]. Among non-Hispanic White women, 25(OH)D-BW/GA association was observed only with male infants, and the effect size was lower (beta = 0.008, SE = 0.003, P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Maternal serum concentrations of 25(OH)D in early and mid-pregnancy were positively associated with BW/GA among non-Hispanic Black male and female infants and non-Hispanic White male infants. Effect modification by race/ethnicity may be due, in part, to overall lower concentrations of 25(OH)D in non-Hispanic Blacks. Reasons for effect modification by infant sex remain unclear.",

        "abstract": "Disinfection is an essential measure for interrupting human norovirus (HuNoV) transmission, but it is difficult to evaluate the efficacy of disinfectants due to the absence of a practicable cell culture system for these viruses. The purpose of this study was to screen sodium hypochlorite and ethanol for efficacy against Norwalk virus (NV) and expand the studies to evaluate the efficacy of antibacterial liquid soap and alcohol-based hand sanitizer for the inactivation of NV on human fingerpads. Samples were tested by RT-qPCR both with and without a prior RNase treatment. In suspension assay, sodium hypochlorite concentrations >/=160 ppm effectively eliminated RT-qPCR detection signal, while ethanol, regardless of concentration, was relatively ineffective, giving at most a 0.5 log10 reduction in genomic copies of NV cDNA. Using the ASTM standard fingerpad method and a modification thereof (with rubbing), we observed the greatest reduction in genomic copies of NV cDNA with the antibacterial liquid soap treatment (0.67-1.20 log10 reduction) and water rinse only (0.58-1.38 log10 reduction). The alcohol-based hand sanitizer was relatively ineffective, reducing the genomic copies of NV cDNA by only 0.14-0.34 log10 compared to baseline. Although the concentrations of genomic copies of NV cDNA were consistently lower on fingerpad eluates pre-treated with RNase compared to those without prior RNase treatment, these differences were not statistically significant. Despite the promise of alcohol-based sanitizers for the control of pathogen transmission, they may be relatively ineffective against the HuNoV, reinforcing the need to develop and evaluate new products against this important group of viruses.",

        "abstract": "Despite efforts to increase access to HIV testing and counseling services, population coverage remains low. As a result, many people in sub-Saharan Africa do not know their own HIV status or the status of their sex partner(s). Recent evidence, however, indicates that as many as half of HIV-positive individuals in ongoing sexual relationships have an HIV-negative partner and that a significant proportion of new HIV infections in generalized epidemics occur within serodiscordant couples. Integrating couples HIV testing and counseling (CHTC) into routine clinic- and community-based services can significantly increase the number of couples where the status of both partners is known. Offering couples a set of evidence-based interventions once their HIV status has been determined can significantly reduce HIV incidence within couples and if implemented with sufficient scale and coverage, potentially reduce population-level HIV incidence as well. This article describes these interventions and their potential benefits.",

        "abstract": "Submicronic fungal fragments have been observed in in vitro aerosolization experiments. The occurrence of these particles has therefore been suggested to contribute to respiratory health problems observed in mold contaminated indoor environments. However, the role of submicronic fragments in exacerbating adverse health effects has remained unclear due to limitations associated with detection methods. In the present study, we report the development of an indirect immunodetection assay that utilizes chicken polyclonal antibodies developed against spores from Aspergillus versicolor and high resolution field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). Immunolabeling was performed with A. versicolor fragments immobilized and fixed onto poly-L-lysine coated polycarbonate filters. Ninety percent of submicronic fragments and 1-2 mum fragments, compared to 100% of >2 mum fragments generated from pure freeze dried mycelial fragments of A. versicolor, were positively labeled. In proof of concept experiments, air samples collected from moldy indoor environments were evaluated using the immunolabelling technique. Our results indicated that 13% of total collected particles were derived from fungi. This fraction comprises 79% of fragments that were detected by immunolabelling and 21% spore particles that were morphologically identified. The methods reported in this study, enable the enumeration of fungal particles, including submicronic fragments, in a complex heterogeneous environmental sample.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) are becoming increasingly available to vulnerable populations at risk for malaria. Their appropriate and consistent use is essential to preventing malaria, but ITN use often lags behind ITN ownership. In order to increase ITN use, it is necessary to devise strategies that accurately identify, differentiate, and target the reasons and types of non-use. METHODS: A simple method based on the end-user as the denominator was employed to classify each individual into one of four ITN use categories: 1) living in households not owning an ITN; 2) living in households owning, but not hanging an ITN; 3) living in households owning and hanging an ITN, but who are not sleeping under one; and 4) sleeping under an ITN. This framework was applied to survey data designed to evaluate long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) distributions following integrated campaigns in five countries: Togo, Sierra Leone, Madagascar, Kenya and Niger. RESULTS: The percentage of children <5 years of age sleeping under an ITN ranged from 51.5% in Kenya to 81.1% in Madagascar. Among the three categories of non-use, children living in households without an ITN make up largest group (range: 9.4%-30.0%), despite the efforts of the integrated child health campaigns. The percentage of children who live in households that own but do not hang an ITN ranged from 5.1% to 16.1%. The percentage of children living in households where an ITN was suspended, but who were not sleeping under it ranged from 4.3% to 16.4%. Use by all household members in Sierra Leone (39.9%) and Madagascar (60.4%) indicate that integrated campaigns reach beyond their desired target populations. CONCLUSIONS: The framework outlined in this paper provides a helpful tool to examine the deficiencies in ITN use. Monitoring and evaluation strategies designed to assess ITN ownership and use can easily incorporate this approach using existing data collection instruments that measure the standard indicators.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Daily pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with Truvada (a combination of emtricitabine (FTC) and tenofovir (TFV) disoproxil fumarate (TDF)) is a novel HIV prevention strategy recently found to prevent HIV transmission in men who have sex with men and heterosexual couples. We previously showed that a coitally-dependent Truvada regimen protected macaques against rectal SHIV transmission. Here we examined FTC and tenofovir TFV exposure in vaginal tissues after oral dosing and assessed if peri-coital Truvada also protects macaques against vaginal SHIV infection. METHODS: The pharmacokinetic profile of emtricitabine (FTC) and tenofovir (TFV) was evaluated at first dose. FTC and TFV levels were measured in blood plasma, rectal, and vaginal secretions. Intracellular concentrations of FTC-triphosphate (FTC-TP) and TFV-diphosphate (TFV-DP) were measured in PBMCs, rectal tissues, and vaginal tissues. Efficacy of Truvada in preventing vaginal SHIV infection was assessed using a repeat-exposure vaginal SHIV transmission model consisting of weekly exposures to low doses of SHIV162p3. Six pigtail macaques with normal menstrual cycles received Truvada 24 h before and 2 h after each weekly virus exposure and six received placebo. Infection was monitored by serology and PCR amplification of SHIV RNA and DNA. RESULTS: As in humans, the concentration of FTC was higher than the concentration of TFV in vaginal secretions. Also as in humans, TFV levels in vaginal secretions were lower than in rectal secretions. Intracellular TFV-DP concentrations were also lower in vaginal tissues than in rectal tissues. Despite the low vaginal TFV exposure, all six treated macaques were protected from infection after 18 exposures or 4 full menstrual cycles. In contrast, all 6 control animals were infected. CONCLUSIONS: We modeled a peri-coital regimen with two doses of Truvada and showed that it fully protected macaques from repeated SHIV exposures. Our results open the possibility for simplified PrEP regimens to prevent vaginal HIV transmission in women.",

        "abstract": "In preparation for HIV-1 vaccine trials in Kenya, 2801 study volunteers, from a tea plantation in Kericho, were recruited as part of a prospective vaccine cohort development study. Cryopreserved plasma was available from 401 HIV-positive volunteers, and was the source of viral RNA for genotyping by the multiregion hybridization assay (MHA). Logistic regression was performed to determine association of risk factors and HIV-1 recombinant and dual infections. At baseline, HIV-1 subtype A was the dominant circulating pure subtype (56%), followed by subtype D (10%) and C (5%). Recombinant HIV-1 strains accounted for almost one-third of all infections (29%), with 7% infected with a dual strain of the HIV-1 variants described. A higher number of HIV-1 recombinant and dual infections was observed among volunteers who were 18-24 and 25-29 years of age, affiliated with the Luo tribe, had been married two or more times, reported not being circumcised, and had STI symptoms in the past 6 months. Adjusted odds ratios (AOR) significantly associated with HIV-1 recombinant and dual infection were age difference from current spouse (5-9 years; AOR = 2.5, 95% CI = 1.2-5.3 and > or = 10 years; AOR = 3.1, 95% CI = 1.5-6.4) and reported STI symptoms in the past 6 months (AOR = 4.8, 95% CI = 2.0-11.6), respectively. In conclusion, our results suggest that there is considerable heterogeneity with respect to HIV-1 subtype diversity in this population that should be considered in the planning for future vaccine trials in the region.",

        "abstract": "Similar to H5N1 viruses, A(H7N9) influenza viruses have been associated with severe respiratory disease and fatal outcomes in humans. While high viral load, hypercytokinemia, and pulmonary endothelial cell involvement are known to be hallmarks of H5N1 virus infection, the pathogenic mechanism of the A(H7N9) virus in humans is largely unknown. In this study, we assessed the ability of A(H7N9) virus to infect, replicate, and elicit innate immune responses in both human bronchial epithelial cells and pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells, compared with the abilities of seasonal H3N2, avian H7N9, and H5N1 viruses. In epithelial cells, A(H7N9) virus replicated efficiently but did not elicit robust induction of cytokines like that observed for H5N1 virus. In pulmonary endothelial cells, A(H7N9) virus efficiently initiated infection; however, no released infectious virus was detected. The magnitudes of induction of host cytokine responses were comparable between A(H7N9) and H5N1 virus infection. Additionally, we utilized differentiated human primary bronchial and tracheal epithelial cells to investigate cellular tropism using transmission electron microscopy and the impact of temperature on virus replication. Interestingly, A(H7N9) virus budded from the surfaces of both ciliated and mucin-secretory cells. Furthermore, A(H7N9) virus replicated to a significantly higher titer at 37 degrees C than at 33 degrees C, with improved replication capacity at 33 degrees C compared to that of H5N1 virus. These findings suggest that a high viral load from lung epithelial cells coupled with induction of host responses in endothelial cells may contribute to the severe pulmonary disease observed following H7N9 virus infection. Improved adaptation of A(H7N9) virus to human upper airway poses an important threat to public health. IMPORTANCE: A(H7N9) influenza viruses have caused over 450 documented human infections with a 30% fatality rate since early 2013. However, these novel viruses lack many molecular determinants previously identified with mammalian pathogenicity, necessitating a closer examination of how these viruses elicit host responses which could be detrimental. This study provides greater insight into the interaction of this virus with host lung epithelial cells and endothelial cells, which results in high viral load, epithelial cell death, and elevated immune response in the lungs, revealing the mechanism of pathogenesis and disease development among A(H7N9)-infected patients. In particular, we characterized the involvement of pulmonary endothelial cells, a cell type in the human lung accessible to influenza virus following damage of the epithelial monolayer, and its potential role in the development of severe pneumonia caused by A(H7N9) infection in humans.",

        "abstract": "While childhood malnutrition is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, less well understood is how early childhood growth influences height and body composition later in life. We revisited 152 Peruvian children who participated in a birth cohort study between 1995 and 1998, and obtained anthropometric and bioimpedance measurements 11-14 years later. We used multivariable regression models to study the effects of childhood anthropometric indices on height and body composition in early adolescence. Each standard deviation decrease in length-for-age at birth was associated with a decrease in adolescent height-for-age of 0.7 SD in both boys and girls (all P < 0.001) and 9.7 greater odds of stunting (95% CI 3.3-28.6). Each SD decrease in length-for-age in the first 30 months of life was associated with a decrease in adolescent height-for-age of 0.4 in boys and 0.6 standard deviation in girls (all P < 0.001) and with 5.8 greater odds of stunting (95% CI 2.6-13.5). The effect of weight gain during early childhood on weight in early adolescence was more complex to understand. Weight-for-length at birth and rate of change in weight-for-length in early childhood were positively associated with age- and sex-adjusted body mass index and a greater risk of being overweight in early adolescence. Linear growth retardation in early childhood is a strong determinant of adolescent stature, indicating that, in developing countries, growth failure in height during early childhood persists through early adolescence. Interventions addressing linear growth retardation in childhood are likely to improve adolescent stature and related-health outcomes in adulthood.  (Am J Phys Anthropol 148:451-461, 2012.

        "abstract": "RATIONALE: Certain outdoor air pollutants cause asthma exacerbations in children. To advance understanding of these relationships, further characterization of the dose-response and pollutant lag effects are needed, as are investigations of pollutant species beyond the commonly measured criteria pollutants. OBJECTIVES: Investigate short-term associations between ambient air pollutant concentrations and emergency department visits for pediatric asthma. METHODS: Daily counts of emergency department visits for asthma or wheeze among children age 5a17 were collected from 41 Metropolitan Atlanta hospitals during 1993a2004 (n = 91,386 visits). Ambient concentrations of gaseous pollutants and speciated particulate matter were available from stationary monitors during this time period. Rate ratios for the warm season (MayaOctober) and cold season (NovemberaApril) were estimated using Poisson generalized linear models in the framework of a case-crossover analysis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Both ozone and primary pollutants from traffic sources were associated with emergency department visits for asthma or wheeze; evidence for independent effects of ozone and primary pollutants from traffic sources were observed in multipollutant models. These associations tended to be of the highest magnitude for concentrations on the day of the emergency department visit and were present at relatively low ambient concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: Even at relatively low ambient concentrations, ozone and primary pollutants from traffic sources independently contributed to the burden of emergency department visits for pediatric asthma.",

        "abstract": "Cells respond to oxidants and electrophiles by activating receptor/transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) to coordinate the induction of cytoprotective genes critical for defense against oxidative and other stresses. Activation involves blocking the ubiquitination-proteasomal degradation of Nrf2. Modification of cysteine thiol groups by inducers in the linker region of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein-1 (Keap1), which congregates Nrf2 into the Keap1/Cul3 E3 complex for ubiquitination, is important but not sufficient for activation of Nrf2. Here we show that evolutionarily conserved cysteine residues of Nrf2 are critical for Nrf2 regulation. FlAsH (an arsenic-based fluorophore) and phenylarsine oxide (PAO) potently induce Nrf2 target genes and bind to Nrf2 in vitro and in vivo. Binding is inhibited by prototypical inducers arsenic and tert-butylhydroquinone. PAO affinity pull-down and mutation of individual cysteine to alanine reveal that Cys235, Cys311, Cys316, Cys414, and Cys506 are critical for binding, and binding is modulated by intramolecular interactions. To corroborate the functions of cysteine residues, Nrf2 wild-type or mutants are expressed in Nrf2 knockout cells to reconstitute Nrf2 regulation. Nrf2 mutants have reduced t(1/2) that inversely correlates with increased binding to Keap1 and polyubiquitination of mutant proteins. It is remarkable that the mutants fail to respond to arsenic for Nrf2 activation and gene induction. Furthermore, mutations at Cys119, Cys235, and Cys506 impede binding of Nrf2 to endogenous antioxidant response element and to coactivator cAMP response element-binding protein-binding protein/p300. The findings demonstrate that Nrf2 cysteine residues critically regulate oxidant/electrophile sensing, repress Keap1-dependent ubiquitination-proteasomal degradation, and promote recruitment of coactivators, such that chemical sensing, receptor activation, and transcription activation are integrated at the receptor molecule.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To compare frequencies of complications among HIV-infected and-uninfected women undergoing common gynecological surgical procedures in inpatient settings. METHODS: We used 1994-2007 data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, a nationally representative sample of inpatient hospitalizations. Our analysis included discharge records of women aged >/=15 undergoing hysterectomy, oophorectomy, salpingectomy for ectopic pregnancy, bilateral tubal sterilization, or dilation and curettage. Associations between HIV infection status and surgical complications were evaluated in multivariable logistic regression models, adjusting for key covariates. RESULTS: For each surgery, HIV infection was associated with experiencing >/=1 complication. Adjusted ORs ranged from 2.0 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.7, 2.2) for hysterectomy with oophorectomy to 3.1 (95% CI: 2.4, 4.0) for bilateral tubal sterilization with no comorbidity present. HIV infection was positively associated with extended length of stay and infectious complications of all of the surgeries examined. For some surgeries, it was positively associated with transfusion and anemia due to acute blood loss. Among HIV-infected women, the odds of infectious and other complications did not decrease between 1994-2000 and 2001-2007. CONCLUSION: HIV infection was associated with elevated frequencies of complications of gynecologic surgeries in the US, even in the era of HAART.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the safety of trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) in children aged 24 to 59 months and to evaluate the risk of medically attended events (MAEs) in a subcohort of children who had multiple annual doses of TIV over their lifetimes. DESIGN: Self-controlled screening study. SETTING: Seven US managed care organizations from October 1, 2002, to March 31, 2006. PARTICIPANTS: Children aged 24 to 59 months who received at least 1 TIV dose (66,283 children and 91,692 TIV doses). Exposure Vaccination with TIV. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Medically attended events in inpatient and emergency department settings in one of the following risk windows: 0 to 2, 1 to 14, or 1 to 42 days after vaccination. All MAEs that met the screening criteria of incidence rate ratios (IRRs) exceeding 1.0 and P </= .05 or IRRs exceeding 2.0 and P < .20 underwent medical record review. A secondary analysis examined the risk of MAEs in children who had multiple annual lifetime TIV doses. RESULTS: Nine diagnoses met the screening criteria. After medical record review, gastrointestinal tract symptoms (IRR, 1.18; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10-1.25), gastrointestinal tract disorders (7.70; 1.11-53.52), and fever (1.71; 1.64-1.80) remained significantly associated with vaccination. None of the events seemed to be serious, and none had complications. In the secondary analysis, there was an apparent dose response for vaccine and allergic reactions in the 1- to 3-day risk window. CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence of serious MAEs following vaccination with TIV among children aged 24 to 59 months. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the risk of MAEs in children with multiple lifetime TIV doses.",

The PCR assay was applied to samples from skin ulcerations of clinically presumptive yaws cases among children on Tanna Island, Vanuatu. Another real-time triplex PCR was used to screen for the point mutations in the 23S rRNA genes that have previously been associated with azithromycin resistance in T. pallidum subsp. pallidum strains. Seropositivity by the classical syphilis serological tests was 35.5% among children with skin ulcerations clinically suspected with yaws, whereas the presence of T. pallidum subsp. pertenue DNA was only found in lesions from 15.5% of children. No evidence of T. pallidum subsp. pertenue infection, by either PCR or serology was found in approximately 59% of cases indicating alternative causes of yaws-like lesions in this endemic area.",

        "abstract": "We have previously shown that infection with laboratory-passaged strains of influenza virus causes both specific degradation of the largest subunit of the RNA polymerase II complex (RNAP II) and inhibition of host cell transcription. When infection with natural human and avian isolates belonging to different antigenic subtypes was examined, we observed that all these viruses efficiently induce the proteolytic process. To evaluate if this process is a general feature of non-attenuated viruses, we studied the behavior of the influenza virus strains A/PR8/8/34 (PR8) and the cold-adapted A/Ann Arbor/6/60 (AA), which are currently used as the donor strains for vaccine seeds due to their attenuated phenotype. We have observed that upon infection with these strains, degradation of the RNAP II does not occur. Moreover, by run-off experiments we observe that PR8 has a reduced ability to inhibit cellular mRNA transcription. In addition, a hyper-virulent PR8 (hvPR8) variant that multiplies much faster than standard PR8 (lvPR8) in infected cells and is more virulent in mice than the parental PR8 virus, efficiently induces RNAP II degradation. Studies with reassortant viruses containing defined genome segments of both hvPR8 and lvPR8 indicate that PA and PB2 subunits individually contribute to the ability of influenza virus to degrade the RNAP II. In addition, recently it has been reported that the inclusion of PA or PB2 from hvPR8 in lvPR8 recombinant viruses, highly increases their pathogenicity. Together, the data indicate that the capacity of the influenza virus to degrade RNAP II and inhibit the host-cell transcription machinery is a feature of influenza A viruses that might contribute to their virulence.",

RIDT results had a stronger association with receipt of early AVs (rate ratio [RR] = 3.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.4, 4.6) than did the presence of risk factors for H1N1pdm09 complications (age <5 years or high-risk medical conditions) (RR=1.9, 95% CI 1.3, 2.7).

        "abstract": "Because pregnant women are at increased risk for severe disease associated with influenza infection, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices have recommended seasonal influenza vaccination for women while pregnant, regardless of trimester. In 2009, a novel strain of influenza A (H1N1) virus was identified, and pregnant women also were found to be at greater risk for influenza-related complications from this new virus (4). As a result, during the 2009-10 influenza season, two separate influenza vaccines were recommended to pregnant women: inactivated trivalent 2009-10 seasonal vaccine and influenza A (H1N1) 2009 monovalent vaccine. To estimate influenza vaccination coverage among pregnant women during the 2009-10 influenza season, CDC analyzed data from 10 states from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS). This report summarizes the results of that analysis, which determined that vaccination coverage for pregnant women among the 10 states combined was 50.7% for seasonal influenza and 46.6% for 2009 H1N1. In addition, women to whom vaccination was offered or recommended by their health-care provider were significantly more likely to report being vaccinated against seasonal influenza (relative risk [RR] = 3.3) and 2009 H1N1 (RR = 10.1). These results indicate substantially higher influenza vaccination coverage among pregnant women than has been reported for previous influenza seasons and support previous findings that receipt of influenza vaccination can be influenced greatly by health-care providers offering or recommending influenza vaccination.",

Progress toward automated surveillance has been ongoing for the last several decades. But as more information becomes available electronically in the healthcare setting, the promise of electronic surveillance for healthcare-associated infections has become closer to reality. Although true fully automated surveillance is not here yet, significant progress is being made at a number of centers for electronic surveillance of central catheter-associated bloodstream infections, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and other healthcare-associated infections. We review the progress that has been made in this area and issues that need to be addressed as surveillance systems are implemented, as well as promising areas for future development.",

        "abstract": "Schistosomiasis is a debilitating parasitic disease of humans, endemic in tropical areas, for which no vaccine is available. Evidence points to glycan antigens as being important in immune responses to infection. Here we describe our studies on the comparative humoral immune responses to defined schistosome-type glycan epitopes in Schistosoma mansoni-infected humans, rhesus monkeys and mice. Rhesus anti-glycan responses over the course of infection were screened on a defined glycan microarray comprising semi-synthetic glycopeptides terminating with schistosome-associated or control mammalian-type glycan epitopes, as well as a defined glycan microarray of mammalian-type glycans representing over 400 glycan structures. Infected rhesus monkeys generated a high immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody response to the core xylose/core alpha3 fucose epitope of N-glycans, which peaked at 8-11 weeks post infection, coinciding with maximal ability to kill schistosomula in vitro. By contrast, infected humans generated low antibody levels to this epitope. At 18 months following praziquantel therapy to eliminate the parasite, antibody levels were negligible. Mice chronically infected with S. mansoni generated high levels of anti-fucosylated LacdiNAc (GalNAcbeta1, 4(Fucalpha1, 3)GlcNAc) IgM antibodies, but lacked a robust response to the core xylose/core alpha3 fucose N-glycan antigens compared with other species studied, and their sera demonstrated an intermediate level of schistosomula killing in vitro. These differential responses to parasite glycan antigens may be related to the ability of rhesus monkeys to self-cure in contrast to the chronic infection seen in humans and mice. Our results validate defined glycan microarrays as a useful technology to evaluate diagnostic and vaccine antigens for schistosomiasis and perhaps other infections.",

        "abstract": "Poisonings from lamp oil ingestion continue to occur worldwide among the pediatric population despite preventive measures such as restricted sale of colored and scented lamp oils. This suggests that optimal prevention practices for unintentional pediatric exposures to lamp oil have yet to be identified and/or properly implemented. Objective. To characterize demographic, health data, and potential risk factors associated with reported exposures to lamp oil by callers to poison centers (PCs) in the US and discuss their public health implications. Study design. This was a two part study in which the first part included characterizing all exposures to a lamp oil product reported to the National Poison Data System (NPDS) with regard to demographics, exposure, health, and outcome data from 1/1/2000 to 12/31/2010. Regional penetrance was calculated using NPDS data by grouping states into four regions and dividing the number of exposure calls by pediatric population per region (from the 2000 US census). Temporal analyses were performed on NPDS data by comparing number of exposures by season and around the July 4th holiday. Poisson regression was used to model the count of exposures for these analyses. In the second part of this project, in order to identify risk factors we conducted a telephone-based survey to the parents of children from five PCs in five different states. The 10 most recent lamp oil product exposure calls for each poison center were systematically selected for inclusion. Calls in which a parent or guardian witnessed a pediatric lamp oil product ingestion were eligible for inclusion. Data on demographics, exposure information, behavioral traits, and health were collected. A descriptive analysis was performed and Fisher's exact test was used to evaluate associations between variables. All analyses were conducted using SAS v9.3. Results. Among NPDS data, 2 years was the most common patient age reported and states in the Midwestern region had the highest numbers of exposure calls compared to other regions. Exposure calls differed by season (p < 0.0001) and were higher around the July 4th holiday compared to the rest of the days in July (2.09 vs. 1.89 calls/day, p < 0.002). Most exposures occurred inside a house, were managed on-site and also had a \"no effect\" medical outcome. Of the 50 PC-administered surveys to parents or guardians, 39 (78%) met inclusion criteria for analysis. The majority of ingestions occurred in children that were 2 years of age, that were not alone, involved tiki torch fuel products located on a table or shelf, and occurred inside the home. The amount of lamp oil ingested did not appear to be associated with either the smell (p = 0.19) or the color of the oil (p = 1.00) in this small sample. Approximately half were asymptomatic (n = 18; 46%), and of those that reported symptoms, cough was the most common (n = 20, 95%) complaint. Conclusions. Lamp oil product exposures are most common among young children (around 2 years of age) while at home, not alone and likely as a result of the product being in a child-accessible location. Increasing parental awareness about potential health risks to children from these products and teaching safe storage and handling practices may help prevent both exposures and associated illness. These activities may be of greater benefit in Midwestern states and during summer months (including the period around the July 4th holiday).",

        "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Postmenopausal hormone therapy with conjugated equine estrogens (CEEs) may adversely affect older women's cognitive function. It is not known whether this extends to younger women. OBJECTIVE: To test whether prescribing CEE-based hormone therapy to postmenopausal women aged 50 to 55 years has longer-term effects on cognitive function. DESIGN: Trained, masked staff assessed participants with an annual telephone-administered cognitive battery that included measures of global and domain-specific cognitive functions. Cognitive testing was conducted an average of 7.2 years after the trials ended, when women had a mean age of 67.2 years, and repeated 1 year later. Enrollment occurred from 1996 through 1999. SETTING: Forty academic research centers. PARTICIPANTS: The study population comprised 1326 postmenopausal women, who had begun treatment in 2 randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials of hormone therapy when aged 50 to 55 years. INTERVENTION: The clinical trials in which the women had participated had compared 0.625 mg CEE with or without 2.5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate over a mean of 7.0 years. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was global cognitive function. Secondary outcomes were verbal memory, attention, executive function, verbal fluency, and working memory. RESULTS: Global cognitive function scores from women who had been assigned to CEE-based therapies were similar to those from women assigned to placebo: mean (95% CI) intervention effect of 0.02 (-0.08 to 0.12) standard deviation units (P = .66). Similarly, no overall differences were found for any individual cognitive domain (all P > .15). Prespecified subgroup analyses found some evidence that CEE-based therapies may have adversely affected verbal fluency among women who had prior hysterectomy or prior use of hormone therapy: mean treatment effects of -0.17 (-0.33 to -0.02) and -0.25 (-0.42 to -0.08), respectively; however, this may be a chance finding. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: CEE-based therapies produced no overall sustained benefit or risk to cognitive function when administered to postmenopausal women aged 50 to 55 years. We are not able to address whether initiating hormone therapy during menopause and maintaining therapy until any symptoms are passed affects cognitive function, either in the short or longer term.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To describe the contribution of mixed dishes to vegetable consumption and to estimate vegetable intake according to specific types of vegetables and other foods among US children and adolescents. DESIGN: The 2003-2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a nationally representative probability survey conducted in the USA. SETTING: Civilian non-institutionalized US population. SUBJECTS: All children and adolescents aged 2-18 years who met eligibility criteria (n 9169). RESULTS: Approximately 59 % of total vegetable intake came from whole forms of vegetables with 41 % coming from a mixed dish. White potatoes (10.7 (se 0.6) %), fried potatoes (10.2 (se 0.4) %), potato chips (8.6 (se 0.5) %) and other vegetables (9.2 (se 0.5) %) accounted for most vegetables in their whole forms, whereas pasta dishes (9.5 (se 0.4) %), chilli/soups/stews (7.0 (se 0.5) %), pizza/calzones (7.6 (se 0.3) %) and other foods (13.7 (se 0.6) %) accounted for most mixed dishes. Usual mean vegetable intake was 1.02 cup equivalents/d; however, after excluding vegetables from mixed dishes, mean intake fell to 0.54 cup equivalents/d and to 0.32 cup equivalents/d when fried potatoes were further excluded. CONCLUSIONS: Mixed dishes account for nearly half of overall vegetable intake in US children and adolescents. It is critical for future research to examine various components of vegetable intake carefully in order to inform policy and programmatic efforts aimed at improving dietary intake among children and adolescents.",

        "abstract": "A limitation of most artificial sweat formulations used for in vitro assessment of chemical release from materials in contact with skin have little biological relevance to human sweat. The purposes of this paper are to provide guidance for preparation of a novel artificial sweat with chemical constituents at concentrations that match human sweat and to characterize chemical stability. The artificial sweat was characterized under conditions of use (with and without sebum at 36 degrees C) and storage (without sebum at -4, 4, and 23 degrees C) over 28 days by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy, high-performance liquid chromatography, enzymatic assay kits, and ion-selective electrodes. Seven indicator constituents were tracked: sodium, chloride, glucose, lactic acid, urea, pantothenic acid, and alanine. With or without sebum at 36 degrees C, the sweat solvent was chemically stable for 14 days. Storage by refrigeration at 4 degrees C retained the chemical integrity of the solvent longest. Based on these results, the solvent should be used within 14 days of preparation. The artificial sweat model presented herein is most similar to human sweat and has applications as a dissolution solvent, donor solution in diffusion cells, or vehicle for patch testing. This sweat model may aid researchers in understanding potential release and percutaneous absorption of chemicals in contact with human skin surface liquids.",

        "abstract": "State and local jurisdictions require children to be vaccinated before starting school to maintain high vaccination coverage and protect schoolchildren from vaccine-preventable diseases. State vaccination requirements, which include school vaccination and exemption laws and health department regulations, permit medical exemptions for students with a medical contraindication to receiving a vaccine or vaccine component and may allow nonmedical exemptions for religious reasons or philosophic beliefs. To monitor state and national vaccination coverage and exemption levels among children attending kindergarten, CDC analyzes school vaccination data collected by federally funded state, local, and territorial immunization programs. This report describes vaccination coverage estimates in 49 states and the District of Columbia (DC) and vaccination exemption estimates in 46 states and DC that reported the number of children with at least one exemption among kindergartners during the 2014-15 school year. Median vaccination coverage* was 94.0% for 2 doses of measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine; 94.2% for the local requirements for diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP); and 93.6% for 2 doses of varicella vaccine among the 39 states and DC with a 2-dose requirement. The median percentage of any exemptionsdagger was 1.7%. Although statewide vaccination coverage among kindergartners was high during the 2014-15 school year, geographic pockets of low vaccination coverage and high exemption levels can place children at risk for vaccine-preventable diseases. Appropriate school vaccination coverage assessments can help immunization programs identify clusters of low coverage and develop partnerships with schools and communities to ensure that children are protected from vaccine-preventable diseases.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: During 1999-2006, rates of unintentional drug-related deaths increased 120% in the U.S. PURPOSE: This report describes demographics and trends of unintentional medication overdose deaths among Oklahoma residents to target prevention strategies. METHODS: Oklahoma medical examiner data regarding fatal unintentional poisonings involving at least one prescription or over-the-counter medication during 1994-2006 and opioid retail sales data during 1997-2006 were analyzed during 2008-2009 to determine demographic-specific rates of overdose deaths and changes in 3-year mean death rates. RESULTS: A total of 2112 fatal unintentional medication overdoses were identified (4.7 deaths/100,000 population) involving a median of two substances/decedent. The highest fatality rates occurred among men (5.9/100,000) and people aged 35-54 years (11/100,000). Crude overdose death rates increased sevenfold during the investigation period, peaking at 11/100,000 in 2006. Death rates increased more for women (ninefold) than men (sixfold); rates among residents of rural counties increased more (eightfold) than urban county rates (sixfold). Leading drug types involved in fatalities were opioids and anxiolytics. The individual drugs contributing most frequently included methadone (31%); hydrocodone (19%); alprazolam (15%); and oxycodone (15%). During 1997-2006, Oklahoma prescription opioid sales increased fourfold. Methadone was associated with the highest number of deaths per equianalgesic dose sold (23.3), whereas hydrocodone and oxycodone had the highest increases in deaths per equianalgesic dose sold (threefold increase each). CONCLUSIONS: Unintentional medication-related deaths are increasing in Oklahoma and often involve multiple substances. Substances most frequently contributing to deaths were prescription opioid analgesics. Prevention strategies should target people aged 35-54 years and emphasize the dangers of coingesting substances and misusing prescription pain medications.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: We examined whether mammographic density predicts risk of second breast cancers among patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). METHODS: The study included DCIS patients diagnosed during 1990 to 1997 and treated with breast-conserving surgery at Kaiser Permanente Northern California. Medical records were reviewed for clinical factors and subsequent breast cancers (DCIS and invasive). Ipsilateral mammograms from the index DCIS were assessed for density without knowledge of subsequent cancer status. Cox regression modeling was used to examine the association between mammographic density and risk of breast cancer events. RESULTS: Of the 935 eligible DCIS patients, 164 (18%) had a subsequent ipsilateral breast cancer, and 59 (6%) had a new primary cancer in the contralateral breast during follow-up (median, 103 mo). Those with the greatest total area of density (upper 20% of values) were at increased risk for invasive disease in either breast [hazard ratio (HR), 2.1; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.2-3.8] or any cancer (DCIS or invasive) in the ipsilateral (HR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.0-2.9) or contralateral (HR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.3-6.9) breast compared with those with the smallest area of density (bottom 20%). HRs for these same end points comparing those in the highest with those in the lowest American College of Radiology Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System category were 1.6 (95% CI, 0.7-3.6), 1.3 (95% CI, 0.7-2.6), and 5.0 (95% CI, 1.4-17.9), respectively. There was a suggestion of increasing risk of contralateral, but not ipsilateral, cancer with increasing percent density. CONCLUSIONS: Women with mammographically dense breasts may be at higher risk of subsequent breast cancer, especially in the contralateral breast. IMPACT: Information about mammographic density may help with DCIS treatment decisions.",

        "abstract": "In response to the recognized need for high throughput biodosimetry methods for use after large-scale radiological events, a logical approach is complete automation of standard biodosimetric assays that are currently performed manually. The authors describe progress to date on the RABIT (Rapid Automated BIodosimetry Tool), designed to score micronuclei or gamma-H2AX fluorescence in lymphocytes derived from a single drop of blood from a fingerstick. The RABIT system is designed to be completely automated, from the input of the capillary blood sample into the machine to the output of a dose estimate. Improvements in throughput are achieved through use of a single drop of blood, optimization of the biological protocols for in situ analysis in multi-well plates, implementation of robotic-plate and liquid handling, and new developments in high-speed imaging. Automating well-established bioassays represents a promising approach to high-throughput radiation biodosimetry, both because high throughputs can be achieved, but also because the time to deployment is potentially much shorter than for a new biological assay. Here the authors describe the development of each of the individual modules of the RABIT system and show preliminary data from key modules. System integration is ongoing, followed by calibration and validation.",

        "abstract": "Cryptosporidium spp. and Enterocytozoon bieneusi are important protists in a wide range of vertebrate hosts, causing diarrheal diseases. Cattle are considered potential reservoirs of Cryptosporidium infection in humans, although their role in the transmission of E. bieneusi is not clear. In the present work, 793 fecal specimens from dairy cattle, native beef cattle, and water buffaloes on 11 farms in China were examined for the presence of Cryptosporidium spp. and E. bieneusi using nested PCR targeting the small subunit (SSU) rRNA gene of Cryptosporidium spp. and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of E. bieneusi. For Cryptosporidium, 144/446 (32.3%) dairy cattle, 44/166 (26.5%) beef cattle, and 43/181 (23.8%) water buffaloes were PCR-positive. Sequence analysis was successful for 213 of the 231 Cryptosporidium-positive isolates; among them 94 had Cryptosporidium andersoni, 61 had Cryptosporidium bovis, 54 had Cryptosporidium ryanae, 2 had a Cryptosporidium suis-like genotype, and 2 had mixed infections of C. bovis and C. ryanae. In dairy and beef cattle, C. andersoni and C. bovis were the most common species, whereas C. ryanae was the dominant species in water buffaloes. The latter species produced SSU rRNA sequences different between cattle and water buffaloes. For E. bieneusi, the infection rate of E. bieneusi in dairy cattle, beef cattle and water buffaloes was 4.9%, 5.4% and 2.2%, respectively. All 35 E. bieneusi-positive specimens were successfully sequenced, revealing the presence of four genotypes: three Group 2 genotypes previously reported in cattle as well as humans (I, J and BEB4) and one Group 1 genotype recently reported in yaks (CHN11). Genotypes I and J were the most common genotypes in dairy and beef cattle, while genotype CHN11 was the only genotype seen in water buffaloes. Thus, the distribution of Cryptosporidium spp. and E. bieneusi in water buffaloes might be different from in dairy and beef cattle in China. These findings indicate that some of the Cryptosporidium species and all four E. bieneusi genotypes identified in bovine animals in the study areas may have zoonotic potential.",

With the ultimate goal to better inform health care providers, public health programs, and policy, changes were made to various aspects of PRAMS to enhance its capacity on assessing and monitoring public health interventions and clinical practices in addition to risk behaviors, disease prevalence, comorbidities, and service utilization. Specifically, the three key PRAMS changes identified as necessary and described in this paper are questionnaire revision, launching the web-based centralized PRAMS Integrated Data Collection System, and enhancing the access to PRAMS data through the web query system known as Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's PRAMS Online Data for Epidemiologic Research/PRAMStat. The seven action steps of Knowledge To Action cycle, an illustration of the implementation science process, that reflect the milestones necessary in bridging the knowledge-to-action gap were used as framework for each of these key changes.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Under its authority to regulate tobacco products, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration prohibited certain characterizing flavors in cigarettes in September 2009; however, flavored cigars are still permitted to be manufactured, distributed, and sold. This study assessed the prevalence and correlates of flavored cigar smoking among U.S. adults. METHODS: Data were obtained from the 2009-2010 National Adult Tobacco Survey, a national landline and cell phone survey of adults aged >/= 18 years old residing in the 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. National and state estimates of flavored cigar use were calculated overall and among current cigar smokers; national estimates were calculated by sex, age, race/ethnicity, educational attainment, annual household income, U.S. Census Region, and sexual orientation. RESULTS: The national prevalence of flavored cigar smoking was 2.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.6%-3.1%; state range: 0.6%-5.7%) and was greater among those who were male, younger in age, non-Hispanic Other race, less educated, less wealthy, and lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgendered (LGBT). Nationally, the prevalence of flavored cigar use among cigar smokers was 42.9% (95% CI = 40.1%-45.7%; state range: 11.1%-71.6%) and was greater among those who were female, younger in age, Hispanic, non-Hispanic Other race, less educated, less wealthy, and LGBT. CONCLUSIONS: More than two fifths of current cigar smokers report using flavored cigars. Disparities in flavored cigar use also exist across states and subpopulations. Efforts to curb flavored cigar smoking have the potential to reduce the prevalence of overall cigar smoking among U.S. adults, particularly among subpopulations with the greatest burden.",

        "abstract": "Nonadherence, or not taking medications as prescribed, to antihypertensive medications has been associated with uncontrolled hypertension. The authors analyzed data from HealthStyles 2010 to assess medication nonadherence among adults with hypertension. The overall prevalence of hypertension was 27.4% and the prevalence of nonadherence was 30.5% among hypertensive adult respondents. Nonadherence rates were highest among younger adults (aged 18-44 years), Hispanics, those who reported lowest annual income (<$25,000), and those who reported depression. The most common reason stated for nonadherence was \"I cannot afford the medication\" (35.1%). A multivariate logistic regression model showed age, race, and household income to be associated with nonadherence. These findings suggest that certain subgroups are more likely to report barriers to adherence. Interventions to support the management of hypertension should consider the identification of certain at-risk subgroups and utilize community and clinical evidenced-based resources to improve long-term control.",

To better understand the magnitude of the epidemic and identify risk factors for dengue virus (DENV) infection, we conducted cluster surveys around households of case-patients and randomly selected households 6 weeks after the peak of the epidemic. Of 173 case cluster participants, 16 (9%) exhibited evidence of recent DENV infection. Of 247 random cluster participants, 25 (10%) had evidence of recent DENV infection. Of 13 recently infected participants who had a recent febrile illness, 7 (54%) had sought medical care, and 1 (14%) was hospitalized with symptoms consistent with severe dengue; however, none received a diagnosis of dengue. Behavior associated with protection from DENV infection included recent use of mosquito repellent or a bed net.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Diarrhea is a leading cause of childhood morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa. Data on risk factors for mortality are limited. We conducted hospital-based surveillance to characterize the etiology of diarrhea and identify risk factors for death among children hospitalized with diarrhea in rural western Kenya. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We enrolled all children <5 years old, hospitalized with diarrhea (>/=3 loose stools in 24 hours) at two district hospitals in Nyanza Province, western Kenya. Clinical and demographic information was collected. Stool specimens were tested for bacterial and viral pathogens. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were carried out to identify risk factors for death. From May 23, 2005 to May 22, 2007, 1,146 children <5 years old were enrolled; 107 (9%) children died during hospitalization. Nontyphoidal Salmonella were identified in 10% (118), Campylobacter in 5% (57), and Shigella in 4% (42) of 1,137 stool samples; rotavirus was detected in 19% (196) of 1,021 stool samples. Among stools from children who died, nontyphoidal Salmonella were detected in 22%, Shigella in 11%, rotavirus in 9%, Campylobacter in 5%, and S. Typhi in <1%. In multivariable analysis, infants who died were more likely to have nontyphoidal Salmonella (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 6.8; 95% CI 3.1-14.9), and children <5 years to have Shigella (aOR = 5.5; 95% CI 2.2-14.0) identified than children who survived. Children who died were less likely to be infected with rotavirus (OR = 0.4; 95% CI 0.2-0.8). Further risk factors for death included being malnourished (aOR = 4.2; 95% CI 2.1-8.7); having oral thrush on physical exam (aOR = 2.3; 95% CI 1.4-3.8); having previously sought care at a hospital for the illness (aOR = 2.2; 95% CI 1.2-3.8); and being dehydrated as diagnosed at discharge/death (aOR = 2.5; 95% CI 1.5-4.1). A clinical diagnosis of malaria, and malaria parasites seen on blood smear, were not associated with increased risk of death. This study only captured in-hospital childhood deaths, and likely missed a substantial number of additional deaths that occurred at home. CONCLUSION: Nontyphoidal Salmonella and Shigella are associated with mortality among rural Kenyan children with diarrhea who access a hospital. Improved prevention and treatment of diarrheal disease is necessary. Enhanced surveillance and simplified laboratory diagnostics in Africa may assist clinicians in appropriately treating potentially fatal diarrheal illness.

        "abstract": "To review research examining the influence of \"connectedness\" on adolescent sexual and reproductive health (ASRH). Connectedness, or bonding, refers to the emotional attachment and commitment a child makes to social relationships in the family, peer group, school, community, or culture. A systematic review of behavioral research (1985-2007) was conducted. Inclusion criteria included examination of the association between a connectedness sub-construct and an ASRH outcome, use of multivariate analyses, sample size of >or=100, and publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Results were coded as protective, risk, or no association, and as longitudinal, or cross sectional. Findings from at least two longitudinal studies for a given outcome with consistent associations were considered sufficient evidence for a protective or risk association. Eight connectedness sub-constructs were reviewed: family connectedness (90 studies), parent-adolescent general communication (16 studies), parent-adolescent sexuality communication (58 studies), parental monitoring (61 studies), peer connectedness (nine studies), partner connectedness (12 studies), school connectedness (18 studies), and community connectedness (four studies). There was sufficient evidence to support a protective association with ASRH outcomes for family connectedness, general and sexuality-specific parent-adolescent communication, parental monitoring, partner connectedness, and school connectedness. Sufficient evidence of a risk association was identified for the parent overcontrol sub-construct of parental monitoring. Connectedness can be a protective factor for ASRH outcomes, and efforts to strengthen young people's pro-social relationships are a promising target for approaches to promote ASRH. Further study regarding specific sub-constructs as well as their combined influence is needed.",

        "abstract": "The toxic plant protein ricin has gained notoriety due to wide availability and potential use as a bioterrorism agent, with particular concern for food supply contamination. We have developed a sensitive and selective mass spectrometry-based method to detect ricin in tap water, 2% milk, apple juice, and orange juice. Ricin added to beverage matrices was extracted using antibody-bound magnetic beads and digested with trypsin. Absolute quantification was performed using isotope dilution mass spectrometry with a linear ion trap operating in product-ion-monitoring mode. The method allows for identification of ricin A chain and B chain and for distinction of ricin from ricin agglutinin within a single analytical run. Ricin-bound beads were also tested for deadenylase activity by incubation with a synthetic ssDNA oligomer. Depurination of the substrate by ricin was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOFMS). This method was used successfully to extract ricin from each beverage matrix. The activity of recovered ricin was assessed, and quantification was achieved, with a limit of detection of 10 fmol/mL (0.64 ng/mL).",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Partner treatment is an important component of sexually transmitted disease control. Several randomized controlled trials have compared expedited partner treatment (EPT) to unassisted standard partner referral (SR). All of these trials found that EPT significantly increased partner treatment over SR, whereas some found that EPT significantly lowered reinfection rates in index patients. METHODS: We collected cost data to assess the payer-specific, health care system, and societal-level cost of EPT and SR. We used data on partner treatment and index patient reinfection rates from 2 randomized controlled trials examining EPT and SR for patients diagnosed with chlamydia or gonorrhea. Additional elements were estimated or drawn from the literature. We used a Monte Carlo simulation to assess the impact on cost and effectiveness of varying several variables simultaneously, and calculated threshold values for selected variables at which EPT and SR costs per patient were equal. RESULTS: From a health care system or societal perspective, EPT was less costly and it treated more partners than SR. From the perspective of an individual payer, EPT was less costly than SR if >/=32% to 37% of male index patients' female partners or >/=29% of female index patients' male partners received care from the same payer. CONCLUSIONS: EPT has a lower cost from a societal or health care system perspective than SR and treats more partners. Individual payers may find EPT to be more costly than SR, depending on how many of their patients' partners receive care from the same payer.",

        "abstract": "The concept of animal and human health experts working together toward a healthier world has been endorsed, but challenges remain in identifying concrete actions to move this one health concept from vision to action. In 2008, as a result of avian influenza outbreaks in West Africa, international donor support led to a unique opportunity to invest in Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Programs (FELTPs) in the region that engaged the animal and human health sectors to strengthen the capacity for prevention and control of zoonotic diseases. The FELTPs mixed 25% to 35% classroom and 65% to 75% field-based training and service for cohorts of physicians, veterinarians, and laboratory scientists. They typically consisted of a 2-year course leading to a master's degree in field epidemiology and public health laboratory management for midlevel public health leaders and competency-based short courses for frontline public health surveillance workers. Trainees and graduates work in multidisciplinary teams to conduct surveillance, outbreak investigations, and epidemiological studies for disease control locally and across borders. Critical outcomes of these programs include development of a cadre of public health leaders with core skills in integrated disease surveillance, outbreak investigation, vaccination campaigns, laboratory diagnostic testing, and epidemiological studies that address priority public health problems. A key challenge exists in identifying ways to successfully scale up and transform this innovative donor-driven program into a sustainable multisectoral one health workforce capacity development model.",

        "abstract": "Essentially all biological membranes and tissues exhibit microscopic heterogeneity in the form of cellular, lamellar or other organization, and molecular diffusion in these materials is frequently slowed by binding to elements of the microstructure (\"trapping\"). This paper addresses situations where binding is describable as a linear reversible process at the microscale, with forward (\"on\") and reverse (\"off\") rate constants kf(x) and kr(x) that vary with position. Very commonly it is tacitly assumed that the macroscopically observable binding behavior should follow the same rate law with the substitution of appropriate effective (tissue-average) rate constants and . This assumption is probed theoretically for spatially periodic microstructures using a judicious application of numerical calculations and asymptotic analysis to prototypical one-dimensional transport problems. We find that smooth microscopic variations produce an anomalous macroscopic exchange between free and bound solute populations that is not well described by a single pair of forward and reverse rate constants, i.e., violates the usual paradigm. In contrast, discontinuous variations (as in two-phase composite media) are evidently well described by the usual paradigm. For the latter case we derive simple and general algebraic equations giving and , and generalize them to any three-dimensional unit cell representing the tissue microstructure. Validity of the formulas is demonstrated with reference to a concrete example describing molecular diffusion through the stratum corneum (barrier) layer of skin, comprising lipid (intercellular) and corneocyte (cellular) phases. Our analysis extends coarse-graining (homogenization, effective transport) theory for irreversible trapping systems to the reversible case.",

There are hundreds of products in the market that utilize nanostructures in their design, such as composite materials made out of carbon or metal oxides. Potential risks to consumers, to the environment, and to workers from the most common passive nanomaterial - carbon nanotubes - are emerging through scientific research. Newer more active nanostructures - such as cancer therapies and targeted drug systems - are also increasing in use and are raising similar risk concerns. Governing the risks to workers is the subject of this commentary. The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 grants the Occupational Safety and Health Administration the legal authority to set occupational health standards to insure that no worker suffers material impairment of health from work. However, setting a standard to protect workers from nanotechnology risks may occur some time in the future because the risks to workers have not been well characterized scientifically. Alternative risk governances - such as dynamic oversight through stakeholder partnerships, soft law approaches, and national adoption of international consensus standards - are evaluated in this article.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Drug resistance mutations (DRMs) can serve as distinct, non-polymorphic markers for evaluating diversity of expressed HIV-1. We screened for resistance mutations during early-acute viremia and examined the diversity in reverse transcriptase (RT) relative to envelope (env) in cases of transmitted drug resistance. METHODS: We evaluated 111 longitudinal plasma samples collected every 2-7 days from 15 individuals who seroconverted for HIV-1 infection in 1994-2000. The samples were screened with sensitive PCR assays for the commonly transmitted M41 L and K70R mutations, and for K65R, which was undetected by bulk sequencing. Mutation-positive samples were further characterized by clonal sequencing of RT and env V1-V3. RESULTS: Resistance mutations were detected in 4 of 15 seroconverters at 5-50 days of viral nucleic acid expression; most mutations disappeared around the time of seroconversion. Clonal sequencing verified low-level K65R at frequencies of 0.4%-4.9%. In each case, K65R co-existed unlinked with variants carrying 2-5 thymidine analog mutations at frequencies of 1.6%-23.0%. In one seroconverter, variants with M184 V and NNRTI mutations were also identified at first RNA expression. Each seroconverter displayed a homogeneous V1-V3 env population. CONCLUSIONS: Reverse transcriptase DRMs demonstrate that the breadth of variants in transmission may be greater than what is reflected in envelope sequences.",

This information is important in the adaptation of Couples Voluntary HIV Counseling and Testing (CVCT) for US MSM. METHODS: 428 US MSM completed an online survey using MySpace.com from March-April, 2009. RESULTS: Of 426 MSM with complete data, 21.1% (90) were not definitively aware that serodiscordance is possible. Factors associated with a lack of understanding that serodiscordance is possible were: never having tested for HIV (OR: 2.0; CI: 1.1, 3.8), compared to testing 0-6 months previously and having a high school education or less (OR: 2.2; CI: 1.1, 4.5), compared to men who had completed at least some college. CONCLUSIONS: A large proportion of young, internet-using MSM in the United States may not understand that HIV serodiscordance is possible within sexual partnerships. Based on these results, we recommend that CVCT provided to male couples in the United States should include education on HIV serodiscordance.",

We sought to determine whether medical providers order folic acid (FA) or folic acid-containing multivitamins (MVI) for their non-pregnant female patients of childbearing age. This is a cross-sectional study using data from the CDC's National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) and National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) (2005 and 2006). Among non-pregnant, female patients of childbearing age (15-44), the proportion of preventive visits during which a provider ordered FA/MVI supplements was determined and compared to pregnant patients. Next, the rates of FA/MVI orders were examined according to race/ethnicity, age, insurance status, region of the country, provider type, contraceptive care, income and education. Analyses were conducted using SAS-callable Sudaan to account for survey design and to obtain population estimates. There were 4,634 preventive visits for non-pregnant women of childbearing age, representing 32.1 million visits nationally. Of these visits, 7.2% included provider-ordered FA/MVI. Multivariable logistic regression analyses revealed that provider-ordered FA/MVI was most common for women ages 30-34, who receive Medicaid, and whose race/ethnicity was other than White, Black or Hispanic. Preventive care visits represent an important venue for counseling regarding the benefits of FA for women of childbearing age, but appear to be under-utilized in all women. Our findings suggest that annually there may be over 29 million missed opportunities to recommend folic acid to non-pregnant women seeking preventive care.",

        "abstract": "The authors examined the relationship of maternal anthropometry to fetal growth and birth weight among 1005 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected women in Lilongwe, Malawi, who consented to enrollment in the Breastfeeding, Antiretrovirals, and Nutrition Study (www.thebanstudy.org). Anthropometric assessments of mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC), arm muscle area (AMA), and arm fat area (AFA) were collected at the baseline visit between 12 and 30 weeks' gestation and in up to 4 follow-up prenatal visits. In longitudinal analysis, fundal height increased monotonically at an estimated rate of 0.92 cm/wk and was positively and negatively associated with AMA and AFA, respectively. These latter relationships varied over weeks of follow-up. Baseline MUAC, AMA, and AFA were positively associated with birth weight (MUAC: 31.84 g/cm(2), 95% confidence interval [CI], 22.18-41.49 [P < .01]; AMA: 6.88 g/cm(2), 95% CI, 2.51-11.26 [P < .01]; AFA: 6.97 g/cm(2), 95% CI, 3.53-10.41 [P < .01]). In addition, MUAC and AMA were both associated with decreased odds for low birth weight (LBW; <2500 g) (MUAC: odds ratio [OR] = 0.85, 95% CI, 0.77-0.94 [P < .01]; AMA: OR = 0.95, 95% CI, 0.91-0.99 [P < .05]). These findings support the use of MUAC as an efficient, cost-effective screening tool for LBW in HIV-infected women, as in HIV-uninfected women.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Occupation has been linked to cardiovascular disease (CVD) incidence and mortality, but few studies have investigated occupation in relation to early atherosclerotic disease. This study examined associations between various occupational characteristics and carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT) in a multi-ethnic sample. METHODS: The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) recruited 6814 adults aged 45-84 years and free of clinical CVD (response rate 60%, 51% female). Questionnaire data were used to determine occupational group (managerial/professional, sales/office, service, blue-collar), psychosocial job characteristics (ie, job demands, job control) and other sociodemographic information. RESULTS: Common carotid artery (CCA)-IMT was greater for blue-collar jobs than for management/professional jobs (mean difference=0.012 mm, p=0.049) after adjustment for age, sex, race, place of birth (US or foreign born) and CVD risk factors. Compared to management/professional jobs, internal carotid artery (ICA)-IMT was greater for sales/office, service and blue-collar jobs (mean difference=0.071 mm, p<0.001; 0.057 mm, p=0.009; and 0.110 mm, p<0.001, respectively) after adjustment for age, sex, race and place of birth. The difference between blue-collar jobs and management/professional jobs remained significant after additional adjustment for CVD risk factors, income and education (mean difference=0.048 mm, p=0.045). Higher levels of control at work were associated with thinner CCA-IMT (mean difference=-0.009 mm, p=0.016, adjusted for age, sex, race and place of birth) but not with ICA-IMT. Job demands had no significant association with IMT. CONCLUSIONS: Blue-collar jobs and low levels of job control were associated with the development of subclinical atherosclerosis.",

        "abstract": "This article challenges the idea that cancer cannot be prevented among older adults by examining different aspects of the relationship between age and cancer. Although the sequential patterns of aging cannot be changed, several age-related factors that contribute to disease risk can be. For most adults, age is coincidentally associated with preventable chronic conditions, avoidable exposures, and modifiable risk behaviors that are causally associated with cancer. Midlife is a period of life when the prevalence of multiple cancer risk factors is high and incidence rates begin to increase for many types of cancer. However, current evidence suggests that for most adults, cancer does not have to be an inevitable consequence of growing older. Interventions that support healthy environments, help people manage chronic conditions, and promote healthy behaviors may help people make a healthier transition from midlife to older age and reduce the likelihood of developing cancer. Because the number of adults reaching older ages is increasing rapidly, the number of new cancer cases will also increase if current incidence rates remain unchanged. Thus, the need to translate the available research into practice to promote cancer prevention, especially for adults at midlife, has never been greater.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rotavirus gastroenteritis is a major cause of mortality among children <2 years of age. Disease burden data are important for introducing and sustaining new rotavirus vaccines in immunization programs. METHODS: We analyzed population-based infectious disease surveillance data from 2007 to 2010 from Kenyan sites in rural and urban slum areas. Stool specimens were collected from patients of all ages presenting to study clinics with diarrheal disease and tested for rotavirus by enzyme immunoassay. Incidence rates were adjusted using data on healthcare utilization (from biweekly home visits) and proportion of stools collected at study clinics from patients meeting case definitions. RESULTS: Rotavirus was detected in 285 (9.0%) of 3174 stools tested, including 122 (11.9%) from children <5 years of age and 162 (7.6%) from participants >/=5 years of age. Adjusted incidence rates for infants were 13,419 and 12,135 per 100,000 person-years of observation in rural and urban areas, respectively. Adjusted incidence rates were high in adults across age ranges. The rates suggest that annually, among children <5 years of age, there are >54,500 cases of rotavirus-associated gastroenteritis in rural Nyanza Province and >16,750 cases in Nairobi urban slums. CONCLUSIONS: Community-based surveillance in urban and rural Kenya suggests that rotavirus plays an important role as a cause of acute gastroenteritis in adults, as well as in children. In addition to substantially preventing illness and complications from diarrheal disease in children, rotavirus infant immunization has the potential of indirectly preventing diarrheal disease in older children and adults, assuming children are the predominant sources of transmission.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The role of relative humidity in the aerosol transmission of influenza was examined in a simulated examination room containing coughing and breathing manikins. METHODS: Nebulized influenza was coughed into the examination room and Bioaerosol samplers collected size-fractionated aerosols (<1 microM, 1-4 microM, and >4 microM aerodynamic diameters) adjacent to the breathing manikin's mouth and also at other locations within the room. At constant temperature, the RH was varied from 7-73% and infectivity was assessed by the viral plaque assay. RESULTS: Total virus collected for 60 minutes retained 70.6-77.3% infectivity at relative humidity </=23% but only 14.6-22.2% at relative humidity >/=43%. Analysis of the individual aerosol fractions showed a similar loss in infectivity among the fractions. Time interval analysis showed that most of the loss in infectivity within each aerosol fraction occurred 0-15 minutes after coughing. Thereafter, losses in infectivity continued up to 5 hours after coughing, however, the rate of decline at 45% relative humidity was not statistically different than that at 20% regardless of the aerosol fraction analyzed. CONCLUSION: At low relative humidity, influenza retains maximal infectivity and inactivation of the virus at higher relative humidity occurs rapidly after coughing. Although virus carried on aerosol particles <4 microM have the potential for remaining suspended in air currents longer and traveling further distances than those on larger particles, their rapid inactivation at high humidity tempers this concern. Maintaining indoor relative humidity >40% will significantly reduce the infectivity of aerosolized virus.",

        "abstract": "Maternal smoking during pregnancy is associated with increased risk of childhood overweight body mass index (BMI). Less is known about the association between prenatal secondhand tobacco smoke (SHS) exposure and childhood BMI. We followed 292 mother-child dyads from early pregnancy to 3 years of age. Prenatal tobacco smoke exposure during pregnancy was quantified using self-report and serum cotinine biomarkers. We used linear mixed models to estimate the association between tobacco smoke exposure and BMI at birth, 4 weeks, and 1, 2 and 3 years. During pregnancy, 15% of women reported SHS exposure and 12% reported active smoking, but 51% of women had cotinine levels consistent with SHS exposure and 10% had cotinine concentrations indicative of active smoking. After adjustment for confounders, children born to active smokers (self-report or serum cotinine) had higher BMI at 2 and 3 years of age, compared with unexposed children. Children born to women with prenatal serum cotinine concentrations indicative of SHS exposure had higher BMI at 2 (mean difference [MD] 0.3 [95% confidence interval -0.1, 0.7]) and 3 (MD 0.4 [0, 0.8]) years compared with unexposed children. Using self-reported prenatal exposure resulted in non-differential exposure misclassification of SHS exposures that attenuated the association between SHS exposure and BMI compared with serum cotinine concentrations. These findings suggest active and secondhand prenatal tobacco smoke exposure may be related to an important public health problem in childhood and later life. In addition, accurate quantification of prenatal secondhand tobacco smoke exposures is essential to obtaining valid estimates.",

The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is developing noise controls to reduce noise generated by horizontal vibrating screens. Horizontal vibrating screen noise is dominated by sound radiated from the screen body. NIOSH researchers analyzed a mechanism suspension system that could reduce screen body-radiated noise. A finite element (FE) model of the entire screen was used to analyze the screen with the added mechanism suspension. The spring rates for the mechanism suspension were tuned to transmit vibration at the mechanism operating speed while attenuating vibration transmitted from the mechanisms to the screen body at frequencies above 100 Hz. The FE results were used to estimate the A-weighted sound power level radiated by the screen sides and feedbox for various mechanism suspension spring rates. The results indicate that a tuned mechanism suspension could reduce the A-weighted sound power level radiated by the screen body due to gear and bearing forces inside the mechanisms by 7 to 18 dB.",

        "abstract": "Mycobacterium bovis, one of several mycobacteria of the M. tuberculosis complex, is a global zoonotic pathogen that primarily infects cattle. Humans become infected by consuming unpasteurized dairy products from infected cows; possible person-to-person airborne transmission has also been reported. In April 2014, a man in Nebraska who was born in Mexico was determined to have extensive pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) caused by M. bovis after experiencing approximately 3 months of cough and fever. Four months later, a U.S.-born Hispanic girl from a nearby town who had been ill for 4-5 months was also determined to have pulmonary TB caused by M. bovis. The only social connection between the two patients was attendance at the same church, and no common dietary exposure was identified. Both patients had pulmonary cavities on radiography and acid-fast bacilli (AFB) on sputum-smear microscopy, indicators of being contagious. Whole-genome sequencing results of the isolates were nearly indistinguishable. Initial examination of 181 contacts determined that 39 (22%) had latent infection: 10 (42%) of 24 who had close exposure to either patient, 28 (28%) of 100 who were exposed to one or both patients in church, and one (2%) of 57 exposed to the second patient at a school. Latent infection was diagnosed in six contacts on follow-up examination, 2 months after an initial negative test result, for an overall latent infection rate of 25%. No infected contacts recalled consuming unpasteurized dairy products, and none had active TB disease at the initial or secondary examination. Persons who have M. bovis TB should be asked about consumption of unpasteurized dairy products (2), and contact investigations should follow the same guidance as for M. tuberculosis TB.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Few studies have examined the relationship between sociodemographic factors and a population-based measure of developmental delay in US children. We identify sociodemographic factors associated with unlikely, probable and possible developmental delay in preschool US children using nationally representative data. METHODS: All children aged 18 months to 5 years in the 2007 National Survey of Children's Health were categorised into three groups based on the likelihood of developmental delay (unlikely delay, possible delay and probable delay) using a modified survey version of the Parents' Evaluation of Developmental Status questionnaire. Bivariate and multivariate multinomial logistic regressions were used to assess relations between sociodemographic variables and risk of developmental delay. RESULTS: Children had increased odds of probable delay (compared with unlikely delay) if they were older (adjusted OR (aOR)=1.41/additional year above the youngest age group (18 months-2 years), p<0.001), male (aOR=1.55, p<0.001), low birth weight (aOR=2.08, p<0.001), non-Hispanic black (aOR=1.50, p<0.01) or Hispanic in a non-English-speaking household (aOR=2.53, p<0.001) versus non-Hispanic white, had lower household income (aOR=1.33 for each decreasing category of poverty level, p<0.001), or received >10 h/week of care at another family's home (aOR=1.71, p<0.05). Only four characteristics (being older, male, low birth weight and Hispanic living in a non-English-speaking household) were associated with increased odds of possible delay compared with unlikely delay. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple factors, including demographic characteristics and indicators of social disadvantage, distinguish children with probable developmental delay from those unlikely to have developmental delay. Fewer factors identify children with possible delay.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To provide input to Australian and New Zealand government decision making regarding an optimal strategy to reduce the rate of neural tube defects (NTD). DESIGN: Standard comparative health economic evaluation techniques were employed for a set of intervention options for promoting folate/folic acid consumption in women capable of or planning a pregnancy. Evidence of effectiveness was informed by the international literature and costs were derived for Australia and New Zealand. RESULTS: Population-wide campaigns to promote supplement use and mandatory fortification were the most effective at reducing NTD, at an estimated 36 and 31 fewer cases per annum respectively for Australia and New Zealand, representing an 8 % reduction in the current annual NTD rate. Population-wide and targeted approaches to increase supplement use were cost-effective, at less than $AU 12 500 per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted ($US 9893, pound5074), as was extending voluntary fortification. Mandatory fortification was not cost-effective for New Zealand at $AU 138 500 per DALY ($US 109 609, pound56 216), with results uncertain for Australia, given widely varying cost estimates. Promoting a folate-rich diet was least cost-effective, with benefits restricted to impact on NTD. CONCLUSIONS: Several options for reducing NTD appear to fall well within accepted societal cost-effectiveness norms. All estimates are subject to considerable uncertainty, exacerbated by possible interactions between interventions, including impacts on currently effective strategies. The Australian and New Zealand governments have decided to proceed with mandatory fortification; it is hoped they will support a rigorous evaluation which will contribute to the evidence base.",

A New York City survey conducted in June 2009 in 554 households affected by the 2009 pandemic influenza H1N1-related school closures showed that, during closure, 30% of students visited at least 1 locale outside their homes. If all the adults in the home were employed, an ill child was less likely to leave home. In 17% of the households, at least 1 adult missed some work because of the closure. If all adults in the home were employed, someone was more likely to take time off work. If other children were in the household, it was less likely that an adult took time off work. The findings of our study will be important when developing future pandemic school-closure guidance.",

        "abstract": "Manganism is a distinct medical condition from Parkinson's disease. Manganese exposure scenarios in the last century generally have changed from the acute, high-level exposure conditions responsible for the occurrence of manganism to chronic exposure to much lower levels. Such chronic exposures may progressively extend the site of manganese deposition and toxicity from the globus pallidus to the entire area of the basal ganglia, including the substantia nigra pars compacta involved in Parkinson's disease. The mechanisms of manganese neurotoxicity from chronic exposure to very low levels are not well understood, but promising information is based on the concept of susceptibility that may place individuals exposed to manganese at a higher risk for developing Parkinsonian disturbances. These conditions include mutations of genes which play important pathogenetic roles in both Parkinsonism and in the regulation of manganese transport and metabolism. Liver function is also important in manganese-related neurotoxicity and sub-clinical impairment may increase the risk of Parkinsonism. The purpose and scope of this report are to explore the literature concerning manganese exposure and potential subclinical effects and biological pathways, impairment, and development of diseases such as Parkinsonism and manganism. Inhalation and ingestion of manganese will be the focus of this report.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Current, ongoing national surveys do not include questions about end-of-life (EOL) issues. In particular, population-based data are lacking regarding the factors associated with advance directive completion. PURPOSE: To characterize U.S. adults who did and did not have an advance directive and examine factors associated with their completion, such as the presence of a chronic condition and regular source of health care. METHODS: Data were analyzed in 2013 from adults aged 18 years and older who participated in the 2009 or 2010 HealthStyles Survey, a mail panel survey designed to be representative of the U.S. population. Likelihood ratio tests were used to examine the associations between advance directive completion and demographic and socioeconomic variables (education, income, employment status); presence of a chronic condition; regular source of health care; and self-reported EOL concerns or discussions. Multiple logistic regression analyses identified independent predictors related to advance directive completion. RESULTS: Of the 7946 respondents, 26.3% had an advance directive. The most frequently reported reason for not having one was lack of awareness. Advance directive completion was associated with older age, more education, and higher income and was less frequent among non-white respondents. Respondents with advance directives also were more likely to report having a chronic disease and a regular source of care. Advance directives were less frequent among those who reported not knowing if they had an EOL concern. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate racial and educational disparities in advance directive completion and highlight the need for education about their role in facilitating EOL decisions.",

Conversely, tobacco companies are producing tobacco products such as tobacco chewing gum and lozenges that resemble pharmaceutical nicotine replacement products, including a nicotine pouch product that resembles snus pouches. This convergence of nicotine and tobacco product marketing has implications for regulation and tobacco cessation. (Am J Public Health.

        "abstract": "On June 25, 2012, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) published a notice of proposed rulemaking proposing to update respirator approval standards in response to a petition to amend our regulations, current requirements for self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) remaining service-life indicators or warning devices. These indicators are built into a respirator to alert the user that the breathing air provided by the respirator is close to depletion. In this final rule, HHS responds to public comment on the proposed rule and revises the current standard, employed by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) located within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), to allow greater flexibility in the setting of the indicator alarm to ensure that the alarm more effectively meets the different worker protection needs of different work operations. This final rule sets a minimum alarm point at 25 percent of the rated service time and allows the manufacturer to offer remaining service life set point at a higher value or values appropriate to the purchaser's use scenario.",

We compared WNV laboratory results in the National Electronic Disease Surveillance System Base System (NBS) to WNV disease cases reported to the state health department from 2008 to 2012. We calculated sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) of NBS reports, estimated the number of disease cases expected per laboratory report, and determined lead and lag times. The sensitivity and PPV of NBS laboratory reports were 86% and 77%, respectively. For every 10 positive laboratory reports, we expect 9.0 (95% confidence interval 8.9-9.2) reported disease cases. Laboratory reports preceded case reports with a lead time of 7 days. Electronic laboratory reports provided longer lead times than manually entered reports (P < 0.01). NBS laboratory reports are useful estimates of future reported WNV disease cases and may provide timely information for planning public health interventions.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Two drinking water systems at U.S. Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, North Carolina were contaminated with solvents during 1950s-1985. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort mortality study of Marine and Naval personnel who began service during 1975-1985 and were stationed at Camp Lejeune or Camp Pendleton, California during this period. Camp Pendleton's drinking water was uncontaminated. Mortality follow-up was 1979-2008. Standardized Mortality Ratios were calculated using U.S. mortality rates as reference. We used survival analysis to compare mortality rates between Camp Lejeune (N = 154,932) and Camp Pendleton (N = 154,969) cohorts and assess effects of cumulative exposures to contaminants within the Camp Lejeune cohort. Models estimated monthly contaminant levels at residences. Confidence intervals (CIs) indicated precision of effect estimates. RESULTS: There were 8,964 and 9,365 deaths respectively, in the Camp Lejeune and Camp Pendleton cohorts. Compared to Camp Pendleton, Camp Lejeune had elevated mortality hazard ratios (HRs) for all cancers (HR = 1.10, 95% CI: 1.00, 1.20), kidney cancer (HR = 1.35, 95% CI: 0.84, 2.16), liver cancer (HR = 1.42, 95% CI: 0.92, 2.20), esophageal cancer (HR = 1.43 95% CI: 0.85, 2.38), cervical cancer (HR = 1.33, 95% CI: 0.24, 7.32), Hodgkin lymphoma (HR = 1.47, 95% CI: 0.71, 3.06), and multiple myeloma (HR = 1.68, 95% CI: 0.76, 3.72). Within the Camp Lejeune cohort, monotonic categorical cumulative exposure trends were observed for kidney cancer and total contaminants (HR, high cumulative exposure = 1.54, 95% CI: 0.63, 3.75; log10 beta = 0.06, 95% CI: -0.05, 0.17), Hodgkin lymphoma and trichloroethylene (HR, high cumulative exposure = 1.97, 95% CI: 0.55, 7.03; beta = 0.00005, 95% CI: -0.00003, 0.00013) and benzene (HR, high cumulative exposure = 1.94, 95% CI: 0.54, 6.95; beta = 0.00203, 95% CI: -0.00339, 0.00745). Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) had HR = 2.21 (95% CI: 0.71, 6.86) at high cumulative vinyl chloride exposure but a non-monotonic exposure-response relationship (beta = 0.0011, 95% CI: 0.0002, 0.0020). CONCLUSION: The study found elevated HRs at Camp Lejeune for several causes of death including cancers of the kidney, liver, esophagus, cervix, multiple myeloma, Hodgkin lymphoma and ALS. CIs were wide for most HRs. Because <6% of the cohort had died, long-term follow-up would be necessary to comprehensively assess effects of drinking water exposures at the base.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Malaria rapid diagnostics tests (RDTs) can increase availability of laboratory-based diagnosis and improve the overall management of febrile patients in malaria endemic areas. In preparation to scale-up RDTs in health facilities in Malawi, an evaluation of four RDTs to help guide national-level decision-making was conducted. METHODS: A cross sectional study of four histidine rich-protein-type-2- (HRP2) based RDTs at four health centres in Blantyre, Malawi, was undertaken to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of RDTs, assess prescriber adherence to RDT test results and explore operational issues regarding RDT implementation. Three RDTs were evaluated in only one health centre each and one RDT was evaluated in two health centres. Light microscopy in a reference laboratory was used as the gold standard. RESULTS: A total of 2,576 patients were included in the analysis. All of the RDTs tested had relatively high sensitivity for detecting any parasitaemia [Bioline SD (97%), First response malaria (92%), Paracheck (91%), ICT diagnostics (90%)], but low specificity [Bioline SD (39%), First response malaria (42%), Paracheck (68%), ICT diagnostics (54%)]. Specificity was significantly lower in patients who self-treated with an anti-malarial in the previous two weeks (odds ratio (OR) 0.5; p-value < 0.001), patients 5-15 years old versus patients > 15 years old (OR 0.4, p-value < 0.001) and when the RDT was performed by a community health worker versus a laboratory technician (OR 0.4; p-value < 0.001). Health workers correctly prescribed anti-malarials for patients with positive RDT results, but ignored negative RDT results with 58% of patients with a negative RDT result treated with an anti-malarial. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this evaluation, combined with other published data and global recommendations, have been used to select RDTs for national scale-up. In addition, the study identified some key issues that need to be further delineated: the low field specificity of RDTs, variable RDT performance by different cadres of health workers and the need for a robust quality assurance system. Close monitoring of RDT scale-up will be needed to ensure that RDTs truly improve malaria case management.",

        "abstract": "We report a fall 2010 cluster of pandemic influenza A/H1N1 (pH1N1) infections in pet ferrets in Lehigh Valley region of Pennsylvania. The ferrets were associated with one pet shop. The influenza cluster occurred during a period when the existing human surveillance systems had identified little to no pH1N1 in humans in the Lehigh Valley, and there were no routine influenza surveillance systems for exotic pets. The index case was a 2.5-month-old neutered male ferret that was presented to a veterinary clinic with severe influenza-like illness (ILI). In response to laboratory notification of a positive influenza test result, and upon request from the Pennsylvania Department of Health (PADOH), the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture (PDA) conducted an investigation to identify other ill ferrets and to identify the source and extent of infection. PDA notified the PADOH of the pH1N1 infection in the ferrets, leading to enhanced human surveillance and the detection of pH1N1 human infections in the surrounding community. Five additional ferrets with ILI linked to the pet shop were identified. This simultaneous outbreak of ferret and human pH1N1 demonstrates the important link between animal health and public health and highlights the potential use of veterinary clinics for sentinel surveillance of diseases shared between animals and humans.",

The potential combined impact of future dengue vaccines can be estimated using mathematical models of transmission. However, there is considerable uncertainty in the structure of models that accurately represent dengue transmission dynamics. Here, we review models that could be used to assess the impact of future dengue immunization programmes. We also review approaches that have been used to validate and parameterize models. A key parameter of all approaches is the basic reproduction number, R(0), which can be used to determine the critical vaccination fraction to eliminate transmission. We review several methods that have been used to estimate this quantity. Finally, we discuss the characteristics of dengue vaccines that must be estimated to accurately assess their potential impact on dengue virus transmission.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) are widespread environmental contaminants that are known nephrotoxins. However, their nephrotoxic effects at low-environmental exposure levels are debated. OBJECTIVE: We examined the association of blood Pb (B-Pb), blood Cd (B-Cd), urinary Pb (U-Pb) and urinary Cd (U-Cd) with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and urinary albumin (ALB). METHODS: We used multivariate linear regression to analyze the association between B-Pb, B-Cd, U-Pb, and U-Cd with eGFR and ALB in adult participants (>/=20 years of age) in NHANES 2007-2012. The dataset was limited to NHANES individuals with both blood and urinary metal measurements. RESULTS: We found a statistically significant inverse association between eGFR and B-Cd and statistically significant positive associations between eGFR and both U-Cd and U-Pb, as well as statistically significant associations between ALB and the 3rd and 4th quartiles of U-Cd. CONCLUSIONS: The inverse association between eGFR and B-Cd, in conjunction with positive associations between eGFR and ALB with U-Cd, suggest that U-Cd measurement at low levels of exposure may result from changes in renal excretion of Cd due to kidney function and protein excretion. However, renal effects such as hyperfiltration from Cd-mediated kidney damage or creatinine-specific Cd effects cannot be excluded with this cross-sectional design.",

        "abstract": "There is limited data on prepregnancy obesity trends specifically among low-income women, a population at high risk for obstetric complications. Using the Pregnancy Nutrition Surveillance System, we assessed prepregnancy obesity [body mass index (BMI) >/= 30 kg/m(2)] trends among women who participated in the Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children in 1999, 2004, and 2008. Prepregnancy BMI was calculated using measured height and self-reported prepregnancy weight. We report unadjusted contributor (state, territory or Indian tribal organization) specific trends, and both unadjusted and adjusted overall trends, to account for changes in maternal age and race-ethnic distributions, using 1999 as the referent. Of the 27 contributors in 1999, 2 had a prepregnancy obesity prevalence <20%, and 1 had a prevalence >/=30%. Of the 35 contributors in 2008, none had a prepregnancy obesity prevalence <20%, and 14 had a prevalence >/=30%. From 1999 to 2008, the overall prevalence of prepregnancy obesity increased among all racial-ethnic groups, except among American Indian/Alaskan Natives, where it remained high, but stable. Overall prepregnancy obesity increased most rapidly among Hispanics, and remained stable from 2004 to 2008 among non-Hispanic blacks. In 2008, prevalence was highest among American Indian/Alaskan Natives (36.1%) and lowest among Asians/Pacific Islanders (10.8%). The adjusted prepregnancy obesity prevalence increased from 24.8% in 1999 to 28.3% in 2008, a relative increase of 14.1%. Prepregnancy obesity among low-income women increased from 1999 to 2008 and varied by race-ethnicity. These data can be used by obesity prevention programs to better target high-risk women.",

To assess reporting capacities and compliance with IHR of all 50 states and Washington, DC, we sent a questionnaire to respective epidemiologists; 47 of 51 responded. Overall reporting capacity was high. Eighty-one percent of respondents reported being able to transmit notifications about unknown or unexpected events to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) daily. Additionally, 80% of respondents reported use of a risk assessment tool to determine whether CDC should be notified of possible public health emergencies. These findings suggest that most states have systems in place to ensure compliance with IHR. However, full state-level compliance will require additional efforts.",

        "abstract": "The Herbei Spirit oil spill occurred in western Korea. A large number of people who participated in the cleanup tasks of the contaminated area were exposed to crude oil component. We developed a method to monitor volatile organic compound (VOC) metabolites in urine, and evaluate the acute exposure caused by the oil spill in exposed volunteer workers (n = 100, 20.7 +/- 2.1 years, mean +/- SD). Acidified urine samples were extracted by SPE, derivatized with trimethylsilyl, and analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Calibration curves were found to be linear from 3 to 1000 ng/mL (r(2) > 0.993). Accuracy was over 82.4%, and precision was less than 24.8%. Using this method, the VOC metabolites, except hippuric acid, were present at higher levels in the urine samples of volunteers after cleanup work. The levels of mandelic acid (MA) and trans,trans-muconic acid (t,t-MU) were increased significantly (p < 0.001). The exposure effect was greater in women than in men. The effect of smoking was analyzed in all exposed and non-exposed groups, with non-smokers showing increased MA and t,t-MU levels related to exposure. The present method was reliable to determine VOC metabolites in urine and could be useful for biomonitoring of acute exposure effects of VOCs.",

        "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) has been increasingly reported among healthy individuals in the community. Recent data suggest that community-associated CDI represents one-third of all C difficile cases. The epidemiology and potential sources of C difficile in the community are not fully understood. OBJECTIVES: To determine epidemiological and clinical characteristics of community-associated CDI and to explore potential sources of C difficile acquisition in the community. DESIGN AND SETTING: Active population-based and laboratory-based CDI surveillance in 8 US states. PARTICIPANTS: Medical records were reviewed and interviews performed to assess outpatient, household, and food exposures among patients with community-associated CDI (ie, toxin or molecular assay positive for C difficile and no overnight stay in a health care facility within 12 weeks). Molecular characterization of C difficile isolates was performed. Outpatient health care exposure in the prior 12 weeks among patients with community-associated CDI was a priori categorized into the following 3 levels: no exposure, low-level exposure (ie, outpatient visit with physician or dentist), or high-level exposure (ie, surgery, dialysis, emergency or urgent care visit, inpatient care with no overnight stay, or health care personnel with direct patient care). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Prevalence of outpatient health care exposure among patients with community-associated CDI and identification of potential sources of C difficile by level of outpatient health care exposure. RESULTS Of 984 patients with community-associated CDI, 353 (35.9%) did not receive antibiotics, 177 (18.0%) had no outpatient health care exposure, and 400 (40.7%) had low-level outpatient health care exposure. Thirty-one percent of patients without antibiotic exposure received proton pump inhibitors. Patients having CDI with no or low-level outpatient health care exposure were more likely to be exposed to infants younger than 1 year (P = .04) and to household members with active CDI (P = .05) compared with those having high-level outpatient health care exposure. No association between food exposure or animal exposure and level of outpatient health care exposure was observed. North American pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (NAP) 1 was the most common (21.7%) strain isolated; NAP7 and NAP8 were uncommon (6.7%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Most patients with community-associated CDI had recent outpatient health care exposure, and up to 36% would not be prevented by reduction of antibiotic use only. Our data support evaluation of additional strategies, including further examination of C difficile transmission in outpatient and household settings and reduction of proton pump inhibitor use.",

        "abstract": "Influenza vaccination is the primary method for preventing influenza and its severe complications. Licensed inactivated vaccines for seasonal or pandemic influenza are formulated to contain a preset amount of hemagglutinin (HA), the critical antigen to elicit protection. There is currently no regulatory method that quantifies neuraminidase (NA), the other major membrane-bound protein thought to have protective capability. This is primarily due to the limitations both in sensitivity and in selectivity of current means to quantify these antigens. Current methods to establish the HA concentration of vaccines rely on indirect measurements that are subject to considerable experimental variability. We present a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) method for the absolute quantification of viral proteins in a complex mixture. Through use of an isotope dilution approach, HA and NA from viral subtypes H1N1, H3N2, and B were determined both directly and rapidly. Three peptides of each subtype were used in the analysis of HA to ensure complete digestion of the protein and accuracy of the measurement. This method has been applied to purified virus preparations, to monovalent bulk concentrates, to trivalent inactivated influenza vaccines, and even crude allantoic fluid with improved speed, sensitivity, precision, and accuracy. Detection of 1mcg/mL of protein is easily obtained using this method. The sensitivity of the method covers the range expected in vaccine preparations, including adjuvant-based vaccine. This LC/MS/MS approach substantially increases the selectivity, accuracy and precision used to quantify the amount of viral proteins in seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccines and reduce the time and effort to deliver influenza vaccines for public health use during the next influenza pandemic.",

        "abstract": "CONTEXT: Although partner violence screening has been endorsed by many health organizations, there is insufficient evidence that it has beneficial health outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of computerized screening for partner violence plus provision of a partner violence resource list vs provision of a partner violence list only on women's health in primary care settings, compared with a control group. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A 3-group blinded randomized controlled trial at 10 primary health care centers in Cook County, Illinois. Participants were enrolled from May 2009-April 2010 and reinterviewed 1 year (range, 48-56 weeks) later. Participants were English- or Spanish-speaking women meeting specific inclusion criteria and seeking clinical services at study sites. Of 3537 women approached, 2727 were eligible, 2708 were randomized (99%), and 2364 (87%) were recontacted 1 year later. Mean age of participants was 39 years. Participants were predominantly non-Latina African American (55%) or Latina (37%), had a high school education or less (57%), and were uninsured (57%). INTERVENTION: Randomization into 3 intervention groups: (1) partner violence screen (using the Partner Violence Screen instrument) plus a list of local partner violence resources if screening was positive (n = 909); (2) partner violence resource list only without screen (n = 893); and (3) no-screen, no-partner violence list control group (n=898). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Quality of life (QOL, physical and mental health components) was the primary outcome, measured on the 12-item Short Form (scale range 0-100, mean of 50 for US population). RESULTS: At 1-year follow-up, there were no significant differences in the QOL physical health component between the screen plus partner violence resource list group (n = 801; mean score, 46.8; 95% CI, 46.1-47.4), the partner violence resource list only group (n = 772; mean score, 46.4; 95% CI, 45.8-47.1), and the control group (n = 791; mean score, 47.2; 95% CI, 46.5-47.8), or in the mental health component (screen plus partner violence resource list group [mean score, 48.3; 95% CI, 47.5-49.1], the partner violence resource list only group [mean score, 48.0; 95% CI, 47.2-48.9], and the control group [mean score, 47.8; 95% CI, 47.0-48.6]). There were also no differences between groups in days unable to work or complete housework; number of hospitalizations, emergency department, or ambulatory care visits; proportion who contacted a partner violence agency; or recurrence of partner violence. CONCLUSIONS: Among women receiving care in primary care clinics, providing a partner violence resource list with or without screening did not result in improved health.

        "abstract": "Between 2008 and 2011, population-based candidemia surveillance was conducted in Atlanta, GA and Baltimore, MD. Surveillance had been previously performed in Atlanta in 1992-1993 and in Baltimore in 1998-2000, making this the first population-based candidemia surveillance conducted over multiple time points in the US. From 2,675 identified cases of candidemia in the current surveillance, 2,329 Candida isolates were collected. Candida albicans no longer comprised the majority of isolates but remained the most frequently isolated species (38%), followed by C. glabrata (29%), C. parapsilosis (17%) and C. tropicalis (10%). The species distribution has changed over time; in both Atlanta and Baltimore the proportion of C. albicans decreased and the proportion of C. glabrata increased, while the proportion of C. parapsilosis increased in Baltimore only. There were 98 multi-species episodes, with C. albicans and C. glabrata the most frequently encountered combination. The new species-specific CLSI Candida MIC breakpoints were applied to these data. With the exception of C. glabrata (11.9% resistant), resistance to fluconazole was very low (2.3% for C. albicans, 6.2% for C.tropicalis and 4.1% for C. parapsilosis). There was no change in the proportion of fluconazole resistance between surveillance periods. Overall echinocandin resistance was low (1%) but was higher for C. glabrata isolates, ranging from 2.1% resistant to caspofungin in Baltimore to 3.1% resistant to anidulafungin in Atlanta. Given the increase at both sites and the higher echinocandin resistance, C. glabrata should be closely monitored in future surveillance.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: African Americans are less likely than other racial/ethnic groups to receive appropriate surveillance, an important component of care to achieve better long-term outcomes and well-being after colorectal cancer (CRC) treatment. This study explored survivors' understanding of surveillance instructions and purpose. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Interviews with 60 African American CRC survivors were recorded and transcribed. Compliance with surveillance guidelines was defined by disease stage and self-reported tests. Four coders (blind to compliance status) independently reviewed transcripts. Frequency of themes was reported by compliance status. RESULTS: Survivors (4 to 6 years postdiagnosis; women, 57%; age >/= 65 years, 60%; rural location, 57%; early-stage disease, 62%) were 48% noncompliant. Most survivors reported receiving surveillance instructions from providers (compliant, 80%; noncompliant, 76%). There was variation in recommended frequency of procedures (eg, every 3 or 12 months) and in importance of surveillance stressed by physicians. Most survivors understood the need for follow-up (compliant, 87%; noncompliant, 79%). Lack of knowledge of/interest in surveillance was more common among noncompliant individuals (compliant, 32%; noncompliant, 52%). CONCLUSION: Patients' limited understanding about the importance of CRC surveillance and procedures may negatively affect compliance with recommendations in African American CRC survivors. Clear and enhanced communications about post-treatment recommendations in this population are warranted.",

        "abstract": "HtrA serine proteases are highly conserved and essential ATP-independent proteases with chaperone activity. Bacteria express a variable number of HtrA homologues that contribute to the virulence and pathogenicity of bacterial pathogens. Lyme disease spirochetes possess a single HtrA protease homologue, Borrelia burgdorferi HtrA (BbHtrA). Previous studies established that, like the human orthologue HtrA1, BbHtrA is proteolytically active against numerous extracellular proteins in vitro. In this study, we utilized size exclusion chromatography and blue native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) to demonstrate BbHtrA oligomeric structures that were substrate independent and salt sensitive. Examination of the influence of transition metals on the activity of BbHtrA revealed that this protease is inhibited by Zn(2+) > Cu(2+) > Mn(2+) . Extending this analysis to two other HtrA proteases, E. coli DegP and HtrA1, revealed that all three HtrA proteases were reversibly inhibited by ZnCl2 at all micro molar concentrations examined. Commercial inhibitors for HtrA proteases are not available and physiologic HtrA inhibitors are unknown. Our observation of conserved zinc inhibition of HtrA proteases will facilitate structural and functional studies of additional members of this important class of proteases.",

Although the terms multidrug-resistant TB and extensively drug-resistant TB are precisely defined, the term multidrug resistance is often loosely used when discussing malaria. Recent declines in the clinical effectiveness of antimalarial drugs, including artemisinin-based combination therapy, have prompted the need to revise the definitions of and/or to recategorize antimalarial drug resistance to include extensively drug-resistant malaria. Applying precise case definitions to different levels of drug resistance in malaria and TB is useful for individual patient care and for public health.",

Limited data suggests that renewable energy will also offer benefits to workers in the form of reduced occupational injury, illness and deaths. However, studies of worker safety and health in the industry are limited. The Mountain and Plains Education and Research Center (MAP ERC) Energy Summit held in April 2011 explored issues concerning worker health and safety in the renewable energy industry. The limited information on hazards of working in the renewable energy industry emphasizes the need for further research. Two basic approaches to guiding both prevention and future research should include: (1) applying lessons learned from other fields of occupational safety and health, particularly the extractive energy industry; and (2) utilizing knowledge of occupational hazards of specific materials and processes used in the renewable energy industry.",

We argue that entrepreneurial culture facilitates collective efficacy for a community and provides a problem-solving capacity for addressing local public health problems. Our analysis demonstrates that communities with a greater concentration of small businesses, ceteris paribus, have greater levels of population health.

This study sought to compare patient characteristics, co-morbidities, mortality, and length of stay by timing of ADHF onset. The surveillance component of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study (2005 to 2011) sampled, abstracted, and adjudicated hospitalizations with select International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification discharge codes from 4 United States communities among those aged >/=55 years. We included 5,602 validated ADHF hospitalizations further classified as preadmission or postadmission onset. Vital status was assessed up to 1 year since admission. We estimated multivariate-adjusted associations of in-hospital mortality and 28- and 365-day case fatalities with timing of ADHF onset (postadmission vs preadmission). All analyses were weighted to account for the stratified sampling design. Of 25,862 weighted ADHF hospitalizations, 7% had postadmission onset of ADHF. Patients with postadmission ADHF were more likely to be older, white, and women. The most common primary discharge diagnosis codes for those with postadmission ADHF included diseases of the circulatory or digestive systems or infectious diseases. Short-term mortality among postadmission ADHF was almost 3 times that of preadmission ADHF (in-hospital mortality: odds ratio 2.7, 95% confidence interval 1.9 to 3.9; 28-day case fatality: odds ratio 2.6, 95% confidence interval 1.8 to 3.7). The average hospital stay was almost twice as long among postadmission as preadmission ADHF (9.6 vs 5.0 days). In conclusion, postadmission onset of ADHF is characterized by differences in co-morbidities and worse short-term prognosis, and opportunities for reducing postadmission ADHF occurrence and associated risks need to be studied.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The epidemics of HIV-1 and tuberculosis in South Africa are closely related. High mortality rates in co-infected patients have improved with antiretroviral therapy, but drug-resistant tuberculosis has emerged as a major cause of death. We assessed the prevalence and consequences of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis in a rural area in KwaZulu Natal, South Africa. METHODS: We undertook enhanced surveillance for drug-resistant tuberculosis with sputum culture and drug susceptibility testing in patients with known or suspected tuberculosis. Genotyping was done for isolates resistant to first-line and second-line drugs. RESULTS: From January, 2005, to March, 2006, sputum was obtained from 1539 patients. We detected MDR tuberculosis in 221 patients, of whom 53 had XDR tuberculosis. Prevalence among 475 patients with culture-confirmed tuberculosis was 39% (185 patients) for MDR and 6% (30) for XDR tuberculosis. Only 55% (26 of 47) of patients with XDR tuberculosis had never been previously treated for tuberculosis; 67% (28 of 42) had a recent hospital admission. All 44 patients with XDR tuberculosis who were tested for HIV were co-infected. 52 of 53 patients with XDR tuberculosis died, with median survival of 16 days from time of diagnosis (IQR 6-37) among the 42 patients with confirmed dates of death. Genotyping of isolates showed that 39 of 46 (85%, 95% CI 74-95) patients with XDR tuberculosis had similar strains. CONCLUSIONS: MDR tuberculosis is more prevalent than previously realised in this setting. XDR tuberculosis has been transmitted to HIV co-infected patients and is associated with high mortality. These observations warrant urgent intervention and threaten the success of treatment programmes for tuberculosis and HIV.",

        "abstract": "An outbreak of Salmonella enterica serotype Agona infections associated with nationwide distribution of cereal from Company X was identified in April 2008. This outbreak was detected using PulseNet, the national molecular subtyping network for foodborne disease surveillance, which coincided with Company X's voluntary recall of unsweetened puffed rice and wheat cereals after routine product sampling yielded Salmonella Agona. A case patient was defined as being infected with the outbreak strain of Salmonella Agona, with illness onset from 1 January through 1 July 2008. Case patients were interviewed using a standard questionnaire, and the proportion of ill persons who reported eating Company X puffed rice cereal was compared with Company X's market share data using binomial testing. The Minnesota Department of Agriculture inspected the cereal production facility and collected both product and environmental swab samples. Routine surveillance identified 33 case patients in 17 states. Of 32 patients interviewed, 24 (83%) reported eating Company X puffed rice cereal. Company X puffed rice cereal represented 0.063% of the total ready-to-eat dry cereal market share in the United States at the time of the investigation. Binomial testing suggested that the proportion of exposed case patients would not likely occur by chance (P < 0.0001). Of 17 cereal samples collected from case patient homes for laboratory testing, 2 (12%) yielded Salmonella Agona indistinguishable from the outbreak strain. Twelve environmental swabs and nine product samples from the cereal plant yielded the outbreak strain of Salmonella Agona. Company X cereal was implicated in a similar outbreak of Salmonella Agona infection in 1998 with the same outbreak strain linked to the same production facility. We hypothesize that a recent construction project at this facility created an open wall near the cereal production area allowing reintroduction of Salmonella Agona into the product, highlighting the resilience of Salmonella in dry food production environments.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a theoretically grounded community-delivered marketing campaign to promote belt-positioning booster seat (BPB) use among vulnerable populations when disseminated by community members. METHODS: A prospective, nonrandomized community intervention trial was conducted to evaluate the \"Boosting Restraint Norms\" social marketing campaign delivered by community partners in Norristown, Pennsylvania (intervention community), between October 2008 and November 2008. York, Pennsylvania, served as the comparison community. In total, 800 vehicles with 822 children aged 4 to 7 years were observed for BPB use, the primary outcome of interest, at baseline (September 2008) and at 6 months after intervention (April 2009). RESULTS: During the study period, a 28 percent increase in the prevalence of BPB use at 6 months was observed in the intervention community with no change in the prevalence of BPB use in the comparison community. After adjustment for child age and gender, vehicle type, driver gender, and driver level, BPB use increased from 39 to 50 percent in the intervention community. CONCLUSIONS: The \"Boosting Restraint Norms\" social marketing campaign, distributed through community organizations combined with caregiver education and a one-time free distribution of BPBs, was effective in increasing BPB use. This study demonstrates the feasibility of utilizing community organizations with established audiences to spread the \"No Regrets\" messaging of the campaign in the community. This study also indicates that spreading evidence-based messages in this manner may effectively change behavior in populations that are often hard to reach. Future studies are needed in which this methodology is tested in additional communities and rural settings.",

        "abstract": "SETTING: Mycobacterium tuberculosis comprises four principal genetic lineages: one evolutionarily ancestral (Indo-Oceanic) and three modern. Whether response to tuberculosis (TB) treatment differs among the lineages is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between M. tuberculosis lineage and time to sputum culture conversion in response to standard first-line drug therapy. DESIGN: We conducted an exploratory retrospective cohort analysis of time to sputum culture conversion among pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) cases reported in the United States from 2004 to 2007. RESULTS: The analysis included 13,170 PTB cases with no documented resistance to first-line drugs who received a standard four-drug treatment regimen. Among cases with baseline positive sputum smear results, relative to cases with Euro-American lineage, cases with Indo-Oceanic lineage had higher adjusted hazards of sputum culture conversion (aHR 1.32, 95%CI 1.20-1.45), whereas cases with East-African-Indian or East-Asian lineage did not differ (aHR 1.05, 95%CI 0.88-1.25 and aHR 0.99, 95%CI 0.91-1.07, respectively). Among cases with baseline negative sputum smear results, time to sputum culture conversion did not differ by lineage. CONCLUSION: Although these results are exploratory, they suggest that the eradication of viable bacteria may occur sooner among cases with Indo-Oceanic lineage than among those with one of the three modern lineages. Prospective studies of time to sputum culture conversion by lineage are required.",

        "abstract": "The Egyptian rousette bat (Rousettus aegyptiacus) is a natural reservoir for marburgviruses and a consistent source of virus spillover to humans. Cumulative evidence suggests various bat species may also transmit ebolaviruses. We investigated the susceptibility of Egyptian rousettes to each of the five known ebolaviruses (Sudan, Ebola, Bundibugyo, Tai Forest, and Reston), and compared findings with Marburg virus. In a pilot study, groups of four juvenile bats were inoculated with one of the ebolaviruses or Marburg virus. In ebolavirus groups, viral RNA tissue distribution was limited, and no bat became viremic. Sudan viral RNA was slightly more widespread, spurring a second, 15-day Sudan virus serial euthanasia study. Low levels of Sudan viral RNA disseminated to multiple tissues at early time points, but there was no viremia or shedding. In contrast, Marburg virus RNA was widely disseminated, with viremia, oral and rectal shedding, and antigen in spleen and liver. This is the first experimental infection study comparing tissue tropism, viral shedding, and clinical and pathologic effects of six different filoviruses in the Egyptian rousette, a known marburgvirus reservoir. Our results suggest Egyptian rousettes are unlikely sources for ebolaviruses in nature, and support a possible single filovirus-single reservoir host relationship.",

To assess ITN use, two independently sampled subsets of children (211 during survey 1 [December 2012-January 2013] and 325 during survey 2 [September-October 2013]) were randomly selected to compare the proportions of positive and negative agreement between caregiver verbal reports at monthly interviews with visual observation of the ITN at home visits. Caregiver-reported ITN use was consistently high during both surveys (96.0% and 98.1%, respectively; P = 0.17). Home visit-based ITN use fell significantly (P < 0.001) from survey 1 (98.6%) to survey 2 (88.6%). The proportions of positive agreement between caregiver report and home visit in the first and second surveys were 98.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 97.6-99.8%) and 93.3% (95% CI 91.2-95.3%), respectively. The proportions of negative agreement in the first and second surveys were 28.6% (95% CI 0-75.0%) and 20.0% (95% CI 0.1-35.0%), respectively. ITN use by children was high in Machinga District, and caregiver reports and home visits with visual confirmation of the net demonstrated a high level of agreement for use of ITNs, but a low level of agreement when ITNs were not used.",

        "abstract": "CONTEXT: Public health has an important and critical role in responding to emerging multidrug-resistant organisms, such as carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention developed a survey as a tool for state health departments to determine carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae prevalence within their region. OBJECTIVE: This report summarizes an assessment of the health department experience with the survey, their perceived roles and responsibilities in responding to an emerging health care-associated pathogen, and potential barriers to public health engagement of acute care facilities in response activities. DESIGN: Key informant interviews consisting of open-ended and 5-point Likert scale questions were conducted. PARTICIPANTS: Interviewees represented state health departments that administered the survey and select states that did not. RESULTS: Of 11 states interviewed, 7 (64%) had administered the survey to acute care facilities. Despite similar competing priorities and concerns about administering the survey, different perspectives emerged among the 11 states; those that administered the survey regarded it as a learning opportunity, whereas other states emphasized concerns about survey logistics and other public health demands. All 11 states perceived the prevention of an emerging pathogen to be a public health priority, but the degree of their action depended on availability of resources and existing relationships with infection preventionists. Health departments had less interaction with other hospital personnel (eg, facility leadership) and limited knowledge of the roles and associated responsibilities of other health care partners (eg, Quality Improvement Organizations). CONCLUSIONS: Although considered a public health priority, response efforts to emerging pathogens were reported to vary among state health departments. A better understanding is needed of the factors that motivate and facilitate state health departments to engage in a public health activity despite the challenges of competing priorities and limited resources. Efforts should also focus on improving the relationship between health departments and hospital leadership and other health care partners.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To characterize the atypical cutaneous presentations in the coxsackievirus A6 (CVA6)-associated North American enterovirus outbreak of 2011-2012. METHODS: We performed a retrospective case series of pediatric patients who presented with atypical cases of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) from July 2011 to June 2012 at 7 academic pediatric dermatology centers. Patients were included if they tested positive for CVA6 or if they met clinical criteria for atypical HFMD (an enanthem or exanthem characteristic of HFMD with unusual morphology or extent of cutaneous findings). We collected demographic, epidemiologic, and clinical data including history of skin conditions, morphology and extent of exanthem, systemic symptoms, and diagnostic test results. RESULTS: Eighty patients were included in this study (median age 1.5 years, range 4 months-16 years). Seventeen patients were CVA6-positive, and 63 met clinical inclusion criteria. Ninety-nine percent of patients exhibited a vesiculobullous and erosive eruption; 61% of patients had rash involving >10% body surface area. The exanthem had a perioral, extremity, and truncal distribution in addition to involving classic HFMD areas such as palms, soles, and buttocks. In 55% of patients, the eruption was accentuated in areas of eczematous dermatitis, termed \"eczema coxsackium.\" Other morphologies included Gianotti-Crosti-like (37%), petechial/purpuric (17%) eruptions, and delayed onychomadesis and palm and sole desquamation. There were no patients with serious systemic complications. CONCLUSIONS: The CVA6-associated enterovirus outbreak was responsible for an exanthem potentially more widespread, severe, and varied than classic HFMD that could be confused with bullous impetigo, eczema herpeticum, vasculitis, and primary immunobullous disease.",

We used local spatial statistics and geographically weighted regression (GWR) to determine the spatial pattern of malaria incidence and persistence in northeastern Venezuela. Seven to 11 hot spots of malaria transmission were detected by using local spatial statistics, although disease persistence was explained only for four of those hot spots. The GWR models greatly improved predictions of malaria risk compared with ordinary least squares (OLS) regression models. Malaria incidence was largely explained by the proximity to and number of Anopheles aquasalis habitats nearby (1-3 km), and low-elevation terrains. Disease persistence was associated with greater human population density, lower elevations, and proximity to aquatic habitats. However, there was significant local spatial variation in the relationship between malaria and environmental variables. Spatial modeling improves the understanding of the causal factors operating at several scales in the transmission of malaria.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Deaths due to diarrhea among US children declined substantially from the 1960s through the 1980s, but have not been recently assessed. We examined diarrhea-associated mortality among young US children from 1992 to 2006 to establish baseline estimates through which the effect of rotavirus vaccines, introduced in 2006, can be assessed. METHODS: National Center for Health Statistics multiple cause-of-death mortality data were used to examine diarrhea-associated deaths and death rates among US children 1 to 59 months of age during 1992-2006. The winter residual method was used to indirectly estimate the annual number of diarrhea-associated deaths attributable to rotavirus. RESULTS: An average of 369 diarrhea-associated deaths/year (3320 total deaths) occurred among US children 1 to 59 months of age during 1992-1998 and 2005-2006. The diarrhea-associated death rate increased 40% between the first 3 and last 2 years of the study period, from an average of 1.6 deaths per 100,000 to 2.3 deaths per 100,000. Black children died at almost 4 times the rate of white children. Diarrhea-associated deaths showed a winter seasonal pattern similar to that of rotavirus, particularly among children 4 to 23 months of age. Using indirect methods, we estimated 25 yearly rotavirus-associated deaths during the study period. Rotavirus vaccination could potentially prevent 21 of these deaths annually. CONCLUSIONS: Diarrhea-associated mortality among US children stabilized but appears to be increasing in recent years. Rotavirus was associated with a small but significant number of preventable deaths. The national multiple cause-of-death data should prove useful for assessing mortality impact of rotavirus vaccination in the United States.",

        "abstract": "The Government of Bangladesh and WHO collaborated in a retrospective vaccine wastage study to estimate overall vaccine wastage rates from January to December 2004 for BCG, measles, DTP and TT. Researchers looked at vaccine distribution and usage patterns in randomly selected districts at both fixed (Upazila) and outreach (Ward) service delivery levels. Wastage was similar at both delivery levels but ranged widely among the sites. Average rates were highest for BCG (84.9%, range 55-93%) and measles (69.7%, range 28-86%) and lower for TT (35.5%, range 10-73%) and DTP (44.4%, range 16-77%). Wastage resulted primarily from opened vials at the ward level but this was reduced at fixed sites where the multi-dose vial policy is followed. A large proportion (30-38%) of records were excluded from the analytic vaccine-specific databases due to data recording errors, mismatches between Ward and Upazila databases, or missing data. The study's results may provide methodological and programmatic guidance for other countries in addressing vaccine wastage issues.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: No consensus exists about which cutoff point should be applied for serum vitamin B-12 (SB-12) concentrations to define vitamin B-12 status in population-based research. OBJECTIVE: The study's aim was to identify whether a change point exists at which the relation between plasma methylmalonic acid (MMA) and SB-12 changes slope to differentiate between inadequate and adequate vitamin B-12 status by using various statistical models. DESIGN: We used data on adults (>/=19 y; n = 12,683) from NHANES 1999-2004-a nationally representative, cross-sectional survey. We evaluated 6 piece-wise polynomial and exponential decay models that used different control levels for known covariates. RESULTS: The MMA-defined change point for SB-12 varied depending on the statistical model used. A linear-splines model was determined to best fit the data, as determined by the approximate permutation test; 3 slopes relating SB-12 and MMA and resulting in 2 change points and 3 subgroups were shown. The first group (SB-12 <126 pmol/L) was small and had the highest MMA concentration (median: 281 nmol/L; 95% CI: 245, 366 nmol/L; n = 157, 1.2%); many in this group could be considered at high risk of severe deficiency because combined abnormalities of MMA and homocysteine were very frequent and the concentrations themselves were significantly higher. The highest SB-12 group (SB-12 >287 pmol/L; n = 8569, 67.6%) likely had adequate vitamin B-12 status (median MMA: 120 nmol/L; 95% CI: 119, 125 nmol/L). The vitamin B-12 status of the sizable intermediate group (n = 3957, 33%) was difficult to interpret. CONCLUSIONS: The 3 distinct slopes for the relation between SB-12 and MMA challenges the conventional use of one cutoff point for classifying vitamin B-12 status. In epidemiologic research, the use of one cutoff point would fail to separate the small, severely deficient group from the intermediate group that has neither normal nor clearly deficient vitamin B-12 concentrations (ie, unknown vitamin B-12 status). This intermediate group requires further characterization.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture is the diagnostic reference standard for bacterial meningitis, its sensitivity is limited, particularly when antibiotics were previously administered. CSF Gram staining and real-time PCR are theoretically less affected by antibiotics; however, it is difficult to evaluate these tests with an imperfect reference standard. METHODS AND FINDINGS: CSF from patients with suspected meningitis from Salvador, Brazil were tested with culture, Gram stain, and real-time PCR using S. pneumoniae, N. meningitidis, and H. influenzae specific primers and probes. An antibiotic detection disk bioassay was used to test for the presence of antibiotic activity in CSF. The diagnostic accuracy of tests were evaluated using multiple methods, including direct evaluation of Gram stain and real-time PCR against CSF culture, evaluation of real-time PCR against a composite reference standard, and latent class analysis modeling to evaluate all three tests simultaneously. RESULTS: Among 451 CSF specimens, 80 (17.7%) had culture isolation of one of the three pathogens (40 S. pneumoniae, 36 N. meningitidis, and 4 H. influenzae), and 113 (25.1%) were real-time PCR positive (51 S. pneumoniae, 57 N. meningitidis, and 5 H. influenzae). Compared to culture, real-time PCR sensitivity and specificity were 95.0% and 90.0%, respectively. In a latent class analysis model, the sensitivity and specificity estimates were: culture, 81.3% and 99.7%; Gram stain, 98.2% and 98.7%; and real-time PCR, 95.7% and 94.3%, respectively. Gram stain and real-time PCR sensitivity did not change significantly when there was antibiotic activity in the CSF. CONCLUSION: Real-time PCR and Gram stain were highly accurate in diagnosing meningitis caused by S. pneumoniae, N. meningitidis, and H. influenzae, though there were few cases of H. influenzae. Furthermore, real-time PCR and Gram staining were less affected by antibiotic presence and might be useful when antibiotics were previously administered. Gram staining, which is inexpensive and commonly available, should be encouraged in all clinical settings.",

        "abstract": "A polyphasic study was undertaken to determine the taxonomic position of 13 Campylobacter fetus-like strains from humans (n=8) and reptiles (n=5). The results of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) and genomic data from sap analysis, 16S rRNA and hsp60 sequence comparison, pulsed- field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis, DNA-DNA hybridization and whole genome sequencing demonstrate that these strains are closely related to C. fetus but clearly differentiated from the present C. fetus subspecies. Therefore this unique cluster of 13 strains represents a novel subspecies within the species C. fetus, for which the name Campylobacter fetus subsp. testudinum subsp. nov. is proposed, with strain 03-427T (=ATCC BAA-2539T = LMG 27499T) as the type strain. Although this novel taxon cannot be differentiated from C. fetus subsp. fetus and C. fetus subsp. venerealis using conventional phenotypic tests, MALDI-TOF MS analysis revealed the presence of multiple phenotypic biomarkers which distinguish C. fetus subsp. testudinum from the present C. fetus subspecies.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Use of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT), such as artemether-lumefantrine (AL), requires a strict dosing schedule that follows the drugs' pharmacokinetic properties. The quality of malaria case management was assessed in two areas in rural Tanzania, to ascertain patient characteristics and facility-specific factors that influence correct dosing of AL for management of uncomplicated malaria. METHODS: Exit interviews were conducted with patients attending health facilities for initial illness consultation. Information about health workers' training and supervision visits was collected. Health facilities were inventoried for capacity and availability of medical products related to care of malaria patients. The outcome was correct dosing of AL based on age and weight. Logistic regression was used to assess health facility factors and patient characteristics associated with correct dosing of AL by age and weight. RESULTS: A total of 1,531 patients were interviewed, but 60 pregnant women were excluded from the analysis. Only 503 (34.2%) patients who received AL were assessed for correct dosing. Most patients who received AL (85.3%) were seen in public health facilities, 75.7% in a dispensary and 91.1% in a facility that had AL in stock on the survey day. Overall, 92.1% (463) of AL prescriptions were correct by age or weight; but 85.7% of patients received correct dosing by weight alone and 78.5% received correct dosing by age alone. In multivariate analysis, patients in the middle dosing bands in terms of age or weight, had statistically significant lower odds of correct AL dosing (p < 0.05) compared to those in the lowest age or weight group. Other factors such as health worker supervision and training on ACT did not improve the odds of correct AL dosing. CONCLUSION: Although malaria treatment guidelines indicate AL dosing can be prescribed based on age or weight of the patient, findings from this study show that patients within the middle age and weight dosing bands were least likely to receive a correct dose by either measure. Clinicians should be made aware of AL dosing errors for patients aged three to 12 years and advised to use weight-based prescriptions whenever possible.",

We are among the first to detect an effect of Medicaid coverage on a clinical health outcome other than mortality.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There was an increase in perinatal hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections in one Arkansas county that disproportionately affected Marshallese infants. METHODS: An estimated 6000 to 10,000 Marshallese, from the Pacific island nation of the Marshall Islands where HBV is highly endemic, live in one Arkansas county. We conducted a retrospective review of hospital and health department records from 2003 to 2005 in that county. We compared maternal screening for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) between Marshallese and non-Marshallese. We also reviewed birth and immunization records for infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers to evaluate postexposure prophylaxis (PEP). RESULTS: Ten percent (n = 41) of Marshallese births and 0.1% (n = 15) of non-Marshallese births were to HBsAg-positive women. Among those born to HBsAg-positive women, Marshallese and non-Marshallese infants were equally likely to receive PEP with hepatitis B vaccine (98% vs. 100%; P[r] = 0.98) and hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) </=12 hours after birth (88% vs. 87%; P = 0.91). Approximately 57% (n = 32) of all infants born to HBsAg-positive women were tested for perinatal HBV infection. The proportion of Marshallese (17%) and non-Marshallese (13%) infants who tested positive for HBsAg at ages 9 to 25 months was similar (P = 0.78). Receiving HBIG >12 hours after birth was the only factor significantly associated with infection. CONCLUSIONS: Although HBV infection was more prevalent among Marshallese compared with non-Marshallese women, there were no differences in infant receipt of PEP and perinatal HBV infection. Delivery hospitals in this county had standing orders to administer hepatitis B vaccine to all newborns, which likely provided a safety net to prevent perinatal HBV transmission in this high-risk population.",

STUDY DESIGN: Data from 37 assessments were reviewed and analyzed to verify that the quantitative analysis results accurately depicted a laboratory's capacity and capabilities. METHODS: Subject matter experts in influenza and laboratory practice used an iterative approach to develop the Tool incorporating feedback and lessons learnt through piloting and implementation. To systematically analyze assessment data, a quantitative framework for analysis was added to the Tool. RESULTS: The review indicated that changes in scores consistently reflected enhanced or decreased capacity. The review process also validated the utility of adding a quantitative analysis component to the assessments and the benefit of establishing a baseline from which to compare future assessments in a standardized way. CONCLUSIONS: Use of the Tool has provided APHL, CDC and each assessed laboratory with a standardized analysis of the laboratory's capacity. The information generated is used to improve laboratory systems for laboratory testing and enhance influenza surveillance globally. We describe the development of the Tool and lessons learnt.",

METHODS: We analysed the right-hand pattern and prostate cancer risk in 1524 prostate cancer cases and 3044 population-based controls. RESULTS: Compared with index finger shorter than ring finger (low 2D : 4D), men with index finger longer than ring finger (high 2D : 4D) showed a negative association, suggesting a protective effect with a 33% risk reduction (odds ratio (OR) 0.67, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57-0.80). Risk reduction was even greater (87%) in age group <60 (OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.09-0.21). CONCLUSIONS: Pattern of finger lengths may be a simple marker of prostate cancer risk, with length of 2D greater than 4D suggestive of lower risk.",

        "abstract": "Epidemiological studies have reported process-specific elevated prevalence of beryllium sensitization (BeS) and chronic beryllium disease (CBD) among workers. However, exposure-response relationships have been inconsistent, possibly due to incomplete characterization of many biologically relevant aspects of exposure, including particle size. In 1999, two surveys were conducted 3-5 months apart at a beryllium metal, oxide, and alloy production facility during which personal impactor samples (n = 198) and personal 37-mm closed-face cassette (CFC) 'total' samples (n = 4026) were collected. Among process areas, median particle mass median aerodynamic diameter ranged from 5 to 14 mum. A large fraction of the beryllium aerosol was in the nonrespirable size range. Respirable beryllium concentrations were among the highest for oxide production [geometric mean (GM) = 2.02 mug m(-3), geometric standard deviation (GSD) = 1.3] and pebbles plant (GM = 1.05 mug m(-3), GSD = 2.9), areas historically associated with high risk of BeS and CBD. The relationship between GM 'CFC total' and GM respirable beryllium for jobs varied by process areas; the rank order of the jobs showed high overall consistency (Spearman r = 0.84), but the overall correlation was moderate (Pearson r = 0.43). Total beryllium concentrations varied greatly within and between workers among process areas; within-worker variance was larger than between-worker variance for most processes. A review of exposure characteristics among process areas revealed variation in chemical forms and solubility. Process areas with high risk of BeS and CBD had exposure to both soluble and insoluble forms of beryllium. Consideration of biologically relevant aspects of exposure such as beryllium particle size distribution, chemical form, and solubility will likely improve exposure assessment.",

        "abstract": "Cutaneous manifestations of Lyme borreliosis in Europe include erythema migrans (EM) and acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans (ACA); the most common non-cutaneous manifestations are Lyme neuroborreliosis (LNB) and Lyme arthritis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the gender distribution of patients with these clinical manifestations of Lyme borreliosis. Data on gender were obtained from the clinical records of patients with Lyme borreliosis aged >/=15 years who had been evaluated at the University Medical Center Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia. Among 10,539 patients diagnosed with EM, 6,245 (59.3%) were female and among 506 ACA patients 347 (68.6%) were female. In contrast, among the 60 patients with Lyme arthritis only 15 (25%) were female (p<0.0001 for the comparison of gender with EM or ACA) and among the 130 patients with LNB only 51 (39.2%) were females (p<0.0001 for the comparison of gender with EM or ACA). Although the proportion that was female in the LNB group was greater than that of patients with Lyme arthritis, this difference did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.10). Although older individuals are more likely to be female in the general Slovenian population, the age of patients with cutaneous versus non-cutaneous manifestations was not the explanation for the observed differences in gender. In conclusion, patients with cutaneous manifestations of Lyme borreliosis were predominantly female, whereas those with non-cutaneous manifestations were predominantly male. This provocative finding is unexplained but may have direct relevance to the pathogenesis of Lyme borreliosis.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Longer nephrology care before end-stage renal disease (ESRD) has been linked with better outcomes. METHODS: We investigated whether longer pre-end-stage renal disease (ESRD) nephrology care was associated with lower mortality at both the patient and state levels among 443 761 incident ESRD patients identified in the USA between 2006 and 2010. RESULTS: Overall, 33% of new ESRD patients had received no prior nephrology care, while 28% had received care for >12 months. At the patient level, predictors of >12 months of nephrology care included having health insurance, white race, younger age, diabetes, hypertension and US region. Longer pre-ESRD nephrology care was associated with lower first-year mortality (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.58 for >12 months versus no care; 95% confidence interval 0.57-0.59), higher albumin and hemoglobin, choice of peritoneal dialysis and native fistula and discussion of transplantation options. Living in a state with a 10% higher proportion of patients receiving >12 months of pre-ESRD care was associated with a 9.3% lower relative mortality rate, standardized for case mix (R 2 = 0.47; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study represents the largest cohort of incident ESRD patients to date. Although we did not follow patients before ESRD onset, our findings, both at the individual patient and state levels, reflect the importance of early nephrology care among those with chronic kidney disease.",

        "abstract": "Potential barriers to colorectal cancer (CRC) screening include preexisting medical conditions (comorbidities), physician recommendation, psychosocial factors, and screening preparedness. This study's purpose was to investigate the impact of comorbid conditions on CRC screening among African Americans. A stage-matched randomized clinical trial was performed. Asymptomatic African Americans over age 50, with a primary care physician, and eligible for CRC screening were recruited at The Mount Sinai Hospital from 2005 to 2008. One hundred sixty-one patients were assessed for referral for, and completion of, CRC screening, comorbid conditions, \"readiness to change,\" and number of physician visits within the observation period. Data was compared to a pretrial index to predict the likely effect of comorbid conditions on CRC screening. One hundred fifty-nine patients completed the study; 108 (68.9%) were referred for and 34 (21.2%) completed CRC screening. No demographic characteristics were associated with CRC screening completion. CRC screening referrals were similar for all patients, regardless of comorbidities or clinical visits. Comorbidities rated as having extreme influence on CRC screening showed a trend toward lower screening rates. There was a significant increase in screening rates among participants in advanced stages of readiness at enrollment. These data suggest that while comorbidities did not predict colonoscopy completion, they may play a role in concert with other factors. This is the only study to assess the effect of screening colonoscopy in an African American primary care setting. We must continue to explore interventions to narrow the disparate gap in screening and mortality rates.",

        "abstract": "Inactivation of infectious viruses during drinking water treatment is usually achieved with free chlorine. Many drinking water utilities in the United States now use monochloramine as a secondary disinfectant to minimize disinfectant byproduct formation and biofilm growth. The inactivation of adenoviruses 2, 40 and 41 (HAdV2, HAdV40 and HAdV41), coxsackieviruses B3 and B5 (CVB3 and CVB5), echoviruses 1 and 11 (E1 and E11) and murine norovirus (MNV), are compared in this study. Experiments were performed with 0.2 mg/L free chlorine or 1 mg/L monochloramine at pH 7 and pH 8 in buffered reagent grade water (RGW) at 5 degrees C. Ct values for 2-4-log10 (99-99.99%) reductions in viral titers were calculated using the Efficiency Factor Hom (EFH) model. The enteroviruses required the longest times for chlorine inactivation and MNV the least time. CVB5 required the longest exposure time, with Ct values of 7.4 and 10 mg-min/L (pH 7 and 8) for 4-log10 inactivation. Monochloramine disinfections was most effective for E1 (Ct values ranged from 8 to 18 mg-min/L for 2- and 3-log10 reductions, respectively). E11 and HAdV2 were the least susceptible to monochloramine disinfection, (Ct values of 1300 and 1600 mg-min/L for 3-log10 reductions, respectively). Monochloramine inactivation was most successful for the adenoviruses, CVB5, and E1 at pH 7. A greater variation in inactivation rates between viruses was observed during monochloramine disinfection than during chlorine disinfection. This data will be useful in drinking water risk assessment studies and disinfection system planning.",

Vibrio cholerae ghosts (rVCG) offer an attractive approach for developing vaccines against a number of human and animal pathogens. In this study, we constructed a multisubunit vaccine candidate co-expressing the serovar D-derived Porin B and polymorphic membrane protein-D proteins of Chlamydia trachomatis and evaluated its ability to simultaneously induce broad-based chlamydial immunity and elicit a vibriocidal antibody response to the Vibrio carrier envelope. Intramuscular (IM) immunization with the vaccine candidate elicited high levels of antigen-specific genital mucosal and systemic Th1 cell-mediated and humoral immune responses against heterologous serovars and strains, including serovars E-H and L. Also, in addition to the multisubunit vaccine, the single subunit constructs conferred significant cross protection against the heterologous mouse strain, Chlamydia muridarum. Furthermore, all mice immunized with rVCG vaccine constructs responded with a significant rise in vibriocidal antibody titer, the surrogate marker for protection in cholera. These findings demonstrate the ability of the multisubunit vaccine to induce cross protective chlamydial as well as vibriocidal immunity and establish the possibility of developing a broadly efficacious Chlamydia-cholera combination vaccine.",

        "abstract": "DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification critical to normal genome regulation and development. The vitamin folate is a key source of the one carbon group used to methylate DNA. Because normal mammalian development is dependent on DNA methylation, there is enormous interest in assessing the potential for changes in folate intake to modulate DNA methylation both as a biomarker for folate status and as a mechanistic link to developmental disorders and chronic diseases including cancer. This review highlights the role of DNA methylation in normal genome function, how it can be altered, and the evidence of the role of folate/folic acid in these processes.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Rotavirus vaccine was recommended for US infants in 2006. We estimated baseline, pre-vaccine burden and monitored post-vaccine trends in gastroenteritis-coded and rotavirus-coded hospitalizations among US children. METHODS: We analyzed data from the State Inpatient Databases (SID) for 29-44 US states over a 10-year period (2000-2009) to calculate gastroenteritis and rotavirus-coded hospitalization rates by age group, sex, and region, among children <5 years of age. By extrapolating observed pre- and post-vaccine gastroenteritis hospitalization rates to the US population <5 years and based on the 2009 cost of a diarrhea hospitalization, we estimated national reductions in diarrhea hospitalizations and associated treatment costs. RESULTS: The pre-vaccine (2000-2006) annual average gastroenteritis-coded hospitalization rate among children <5 years of age was 74 per 10,000 (annual range: 71-82 per 10,000), and declined to 51 and 50 per 10,000 in 2008 and 2009, respectively (p < 0.001). The pre-vaccine (2000-2006) annual average rotavirus-coded hospitalization rate among children <5 years of age was 15 per 10,000 (annual range: 13-18 per 10,000), and declined to 5 and 6 per 10,000 in 2008 and 2009, respectively (p < 0.001). The decreases in rotavirus-coded hospitalization rates in 2008 and 2009 compared with rates in pre-vaccine years were observed among all age-groups and US regions. Nationally, during 2008 and 2009 combined, we estimated a reduction of ~77,000 diarrhea hospitalizations and approximately $242 million in hospital costs. CONCLUSION: Since implementation of the US rotavirus vaccination program, a marked reduction in diarrhea hospitalizations and related hospital charges has occurred among US children.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected persons have higher cardiovascular disease risk. Little is known about asymptomatic abnormalities in cardiac structure and function in this population. METHODS: The Study to Understand the Natural History of HIV/AIDS in the Era of Effective Therapy (SUN Study) is a prospective, observational, multi-site cohort of 656 HIV-infected participants who underwent baseline echocardiography during 2004-2006. We examined prevalence of and factors associated with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD), diastolic dysfunction (DD), pulmonary hypertension (PHTN), left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), and left atrial enlargement (LAE). RESULTS: Participant characteristics were as follows: median age, 41 years; 24% women; 29% non-Hispanic black; 73% receiving HAART; and median CD4+ cell count, 462 cells/muL. Among evaluable participants, 18% had LVSD, 26% had DD, 57% had PHTN (right ventricular pressure >30 mm Hg), 6.5% had LVH, and 40% had LAE. In multivariate analyses, significant factors (P < .05) associated with LVSD were history of MI, elevated highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) level, and current tobacco smoking; for DD, elevated hsCRP level and hypertension; for PHTN, current use of ritonavir; for LVH, hypertension, diabetes, non-white race, female sex with elevated body mass index, calculated as the weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters, of >/= 25, elevated hsCRP level, and current use of abacavir; for LAE, hypertension and recent marijuana use. CONCLUSIONS: In this large contemporary HIV cohort, the prevalence of subclinical functional and structural cardiac abnormalities was greater than expected for age. Abnormalities were mostly associated with expected and often modifiable risks. Lifestyle modification should become a greater priority in the management of chronic HIV disease.",

We evaluated drug concentrations among men who have sex with men in a substudy of the iPrEx trial (1). In this randomized placebo-controlled trial, daily oral doses of emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate were used as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in men who have sex with men. Drug was detected less frequently in blood plasma and in viable cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in HIV-infected cases at the visit when HIV was first discovered compared with controls at the matched time point of the study (8% versus 44%; P < 0.001) and in the 90 days before that visit (11% versus 51%; P < 0.001). An intracellular concentration of the active form of tenofovir, tenofovir-diphosphate (TFV-DP), of 16 fmol per million PBMCs was associated with a 90% reduction in HIV acquisition relative to the placebo arm. Directly observed dosing in a separate study, the STRAND trial, yielded TFV-DP concentrations that, when analyzed according to the iPrEx model, corresponded to an HIV-1 risk reduction of 76% for two doses per week, 96% for four doses per week, and 99% for seven doses per week. Prophylactic benefits were observed over a range of doses and drug concentrations, suggesting ways to optimize PrEP regimens for this population.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In April 2009, a new pandemic strain of influenza infected thousands of persons in Mexico and the United States and spread rapidly worldwide. During the ensuing summer months, cases ebbed in the Northern Hemisphere while the Southern Hemisphere experienced a typical influenza season dominated by the novel strain. In the fall, a second wave of pandemic H1N1 swept through the United States, peaking in most parts of the country by mid October and returning to baseline levels by early December. The objective was to determine the seroprevalence of antibodies against the pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza strain by decade of birth among Pittsburgh-area residents. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Anonymous blood samples were obtained from clinical laboratories and categorized by decade of birth from 1920-2009. Using hemagglutination-inhibition assays, approximately 100 samples per decade (n= 846) were tested from blood samples drawn on hospital and clinic patients in mid-November and early December 2009. Age specific seroprevalences against pandemic H1N1 (A/California/7/2009) were measured and compared to seroprevalences against H1N1 strains that had previously circulated in the population in 2007, 1957, and 1918. (A/Brisbane/59/2007, A/Denver/1/1957, and A/South Carolina/1/1918). Stored serum samples from healthy, young adults from 2008 were used as a control group (n=100). Seroprevalences against pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza varied by age group, with children age 10-19 years having the highest seroprevalence (45%), and persons age 70-79 years having the lowest (5%). The baseline seroprevalence among control samples from 18-24 year-olds was 6%. Overall seroprevalence against pandemic H1N1 across all age groups was approximately 21%. CONCLUSIONS: After the peak of the second wave of 2009 H1N1, HAI seroprevalence results suggest that 21% of persons in the Pittsburgh area had become infected and developed immunity. Extrapolating to the entire US population, we estimate that at least 63 million persons became infected in 2009. As was observed among clinical cases, this sero-epidemiological study revealed highest infection rates among school-age children.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The International Nosocomial Infection Control Consortium (INICC) was established in 15 developing countries to reduce infection rates in resource-limited hospitals by focusing on education and feedback of outcome surveillance (infection rates) and process surveillance (adherence to infection control measures). We report a time-sequence analysis of the effectiveness of this approach in reducing rates of central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) and associated deaths in 86 intensive care units with a minimum of 6-month INICC membership. METHODS: Pooled CLABSI rates during the first 3 months (baseline) were compared with rates at 6-month intervals during the first 24 months in 53,719 patients (190,905 central line-days). Process surveillance results at baseline were compared with intervention period data. RESULTS: During the first 6 months, CLABSI incidence decreased by 33% (from 14.5 to 9.7 CLABSIs per 1,000 central line-days). Over the first 24 months there was a cumulative reduction from baseline of 54% (from 16.0 to 7.4 CLABSIs per 1,000 central line-days; relative risk, 0.46 [95% confidence interval, 0.33-0.63]; [Formula: see text]). The number of deaths in patients with CLABSI decreased by 58%. During the intervention period, hand hygiene adherence improved from 50% to 60% ([Formula: see text]); the percentage of intensive care units that used maximal sterile barriers at insertion increased from 45% to 85% ([Formula: see text]), that adopted chlorhexidine for antisepsis increased from 7% to 27% ([Formula: see text]), and that sought to remove unneeded catheters increased from 37% to 83% ([Formula: see text]); and the duration of central line placement decreased from 4.1 to 3.5 days ([Formula: see text]). CONCLUSIONS: Education, performance feedback, and outcome and process surveillance of CLABSI rates significantly improved infection control adherence, reducing the CLABSI incidence by 54% and the number of CLABSI-associated deaths by 58% in INICC hospitals during the first 2 years.",

        "abstract": "Permethrin is used worldwide as a mosquito insecticide for netting and fabric. Permethrin is a contact insecticide so only the permethrin on the surface can directly impact the mosquito. Therefore, knowledge of the surface concentration of the insecticide is essential to measure the effectiveness of the treated material. Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry analysis of permethrin showed Cl- as the predominant species in the negative ion mass spectrum. The netting material in this study is composed of high density polyethylene (HDPE). Ion implantation was used to place a known amount of chlorine into the netting material, sheet HDPE, and silicon samples. Depth profile analysis of the implanted samples showed distinct chlorine implant profiles, with the silicon sample used to verify implant dose. Quantification and detection limit for chlorine have been obtained for HDPE sheet and netting. The chlorine detection limit in HDPE is approximately 2 × 1018 atoms/cm3, and the chlorine concentration in netting fibers ranged from 4 × 1019 to 1.2 × 1020 atoms/cm3, which compares very well with the amount of insecticide put into the netting during fabrication. The results make possible the study of insecticide content at the surface and in the bulk of the netting. Investigation is in progress for the effect of washing mosquito nets on surface chlorine concentration. © 2016 American Vacuum Society.",

        "abstract": "Acute otitis externa (AOE) (swimmer's ear) is inflammation of the external auditory canal most often caused by bacterial infection. AOE is characterized by pain, tenderness, redness, and swelling of the external ear canal, and occasionally, purulent exudate. AOE is associated with water exposure (e.g., recreational water activities, bathing, and excessive sweating) and warm, humid environments. Because the overall burden and epidemiology of AOE in the United States have not been well described, data from national ambulatory-care and emergency department (ED) databases were analyzed to characterize the incidence, demographics, and seasonality of AOE and associated health-care costs. The analysis showed that in 2007, an estimated 2.4 million U.S. health-care visits (8.1 visits per 1,000 population) resulted in a diagnosis of AOE. Estimated annual rates of ambulatory-care visits for AOE during 2003--2007 were highest among children aged 5--9 years (18.6) and 10--14 years (15.8); however, 53% of visits occurred among adults aged >/=20 years. Incidence peaked during summer months, and the regional rate was highest in the South. Direct health-care costs for nonhospitalized AOE visits total as much as $0.5 billion annually, and ambulatory-care clinicians spend nearly 600,000 hours annually treating AOE. Suggested AOE prevention measures include reducing exposure of the ears to water (e.g., using ear plugs or swim caps and using alcohol-based ear-drying solutions) (3--5). To reduce the national incidence of AOE, additional preventive measures should be investigated, and effective prevention messages should be developed and disseminated.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: We sought to describe autism spectrum disorder (ASD) population characteristics and changes in identified prevalence across 3 time periods. METHODS: Children with a potential ASD were identified through records abstraction at multiple sources with clinician review based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV-TR) criteria. Multisite, population-based data from the Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network were analyzed from areas of Arizona (AZ), Georgia (GA), Maryland (MD), and South Carolina (SC). Participants were 8-year-old children (born in 1992, 1994, or 1996) in 2000, 2002, or 2004 (and children born in 1988 residing in metropolitan Atlanta in 1996) who had been evaluated for a variety of developmental concerns at education and/or health sources. RESULTS: From 2000 to 2004, the identified prevalence of the ASDs per 1,000 8-year-old children showed significant increases of 38% in GA and 72% in MD and a nonsignificant increase of 26% in AZ. ASD prevalence was relatively stable in SC with a nonsignificant decrease of 17%. Males had a higher identified prevalence of ASD in all years. Increases among racial, ethnic, and cognitive functioning subgroups varied by site and surveillance year. More children were classified with an ASD by community professionals over time, except in AZ. CONCLUSIONS: There was a trend toward increase in identified ASD prevalence among 8-year-old children who met the surveillance case definition in 3 of the 4 study sites from 2000 to 2004. Some of the observed increases are due to improved ascertainment; however, a true increase in ASD symptoms cannot be ruled out. These data confirm that the prevalence of ASDs is undergoing significant change in some areas of the United States and that ASDs continue to be of urgent public health concern. 2010 Elsevier Inc.

This breathing mannequin-based study utilized infrared camera technology to examine the maximum surface temperature attained in two models of N95 filtering facepiece respirators with exhalation valves compared to two similar respirators without exhalation valves. No significant differences were noted when comparing respirators without valves to respirators with valves from the same manufacturer; however, respirators with valves, as a group, tended to exhibit a greater maximal surface temperature than respirators without valves (p=0.05). At sedentary breathing volumes of one hour duration, N95 filtering facepiece respirators with exhalation valves may offer no benefit in heat dissipation over that of similar filtering facepiece respirators without exhalation valves.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Efficient and reliable laboratory services are essential to effective and well-functioning health systems. Laboratory managers play a critical role in ensuring the quality and timeliness of these services. However, few laboratory management programmes focus on the competencies required for the daily operations of a laboratory in resource-limited settings. This report provides a detailed description of an innovative laboratory management training tool called Strengthening Laboratory Management Toward Accreditation (SLMTA) and highlights some challenges, achievements and lessons learned during the first five years of implementation (2009-2013) in developing countries. PROGRAMME: SLMTA is a competency-based programme that uses a series of short courses and work-based learning projects to effect immediate and measurable laboratory improvement, while empowering laboratory managers to implement practical quality management systems to ensure better patient care. A SLMTA training programme spans from 12 to 18 months; after each workshop, participants implement improvement projects supported by regular supervisory visits or on-site mentoring. In order to assess strengths, weaknesses and progress made by the laboratory, audits are conducted using the World Health Organization's Regional Office for Africa (WHO AFRO) Stepwise Laboratory Quality Improvement Process Towards Accreditation (SLIPTA) checklist, which is based on International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 15189 requirements. These internal audits are conducted at the beginning and end of the SLMTA training programme. CONCLUSION: Within five years, SLMTA had been implemented in 617 laboratories in 47 countries, transforming the laboratory landscape in developing countries. To our knowledge, SLMTA is the first programme that makes an explicit connection between the performance of specific management behaviours and routines and ISO 15189 requirements. Because of this close relationship, SLMTA is uniquely positioned to help laboratories seek accreditation to ISO 15189.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Nosocomial spread of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection can cause severe disease among vulnerable patient-populations and healthcare personnel (HCP). Limited data are available on duration of varicella vaccine-induced protection among adults and to what extent cell-mediated immunity (CMI) and antibody avidity contribute to protection. OBJECTIVE: Evaluate humoral and cell-mediated immune responses of HCP who received a 2-dose regimen of varicella vaccine, and observe the responses to a 3rd vaccine dose among HCP who were seronegative after vaccination. STUDY DESIGN: A convenience sample of HCP with documented 2 doses of varicella vaccine was used to assess acquired VZV immune parameters (cytokine production, IgG avidity). HCP seronegative after 2 doses of vaccine were offered a third dose and evaluated further. Vaccine recipients' immune responses were compared with responses from persons with history of wild-type VZV infection. RESULTS: The convenience sample consisted of 101 HCP with documented 2 doses of varicella vaccine; 12 (11.9%) were seronegative post-vaccination. 11.5% of 61 seropositive 2-dose recipients produced low avidity antibody, suggesting suboptimal response to vaccine. Seven 2-dose vaccinees who were VZV seronegative seroconverted after a third dose; however, 3/7 (42.9%) produced low avidity IgG. 142 persons with a history of varicella were all VZV IgG seropositive, and all had moderate to high avidity IgG. CONCLUSIONS: Measurements of serum IgG titers alone may not accurately reflect vaccine protection. Varicella vaccination of HCP remains important but further studies are needed to evaluate CMI and antibody avidity responses in HCP vaccinated with two doses of varicella vaccine.",

        "abstract": "This article considers ethical dilemmas that nurse managers may confront and suggests an ethical decision-making model that could be used as a tool for resolving such dilemmas. The focus of the article is on the question: Can nurse managers choose the ethically right solution in conflicting situations when nurses' rights collide with patients' rights to quality care in a world of cost-effective and economic constraint? Managers' responsibility is to ensure and facilitate a safe and ethical working environment in which nurses are able to give quality care to their patients. In nursing it is frequently declared that managers' main obligations are to patients' needs and their rights to receive quality care. However, managers' ethical responsibilities are not only to patients but also to the nurses working in their institution. This article describes a real (but disguised) situation from an Israeli health care context to illustrate the dilemmas that may arise. The question is posed of whether nurse managers can maintain patients' and nurses' rights and, at the same time, fulfill their obligation to the conflicting demands of the organization. The article also offers a way to solve conflict by using an ethical decision-making model.",

        "abstract": "The well-being of military personnel and their families is a topic of growing concern in public health. The effects of military service on physical and psychological health, especially after extended overseas deployments, are complex. There may also be long-term consequences of military service for the health and health care utilization of veterans as they age. Today, over 12 million men aged 25-64 in the United States are veterans, representing 15% of the total U.S. male population at those ages. More attention is now being paid to gathering accurate data to help veterans readjust to civilian life (3). Many studies of veterans only use information from military or veteran databases, which limits the ability to make comparisons with the overall population. This report uses data from the 2007-2010 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) to describe the health status of community-dwelling male veterans aged 25-64. It directly compares the health status of veterans with nonveterans on a variety of measures.",

        "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: The rabies virus causes a fatal encephalitis and can be transmitted through tissue or organ transplantation. In February 2013, a kidney recipient with no reported exposures to potentially rabid animals died from rabies 18 months after transplantation. OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether organ transplantation was the source of rabies virus exposure in the kidney recipient, and to evaluate for and prevent rabies in other transplant recipients from the same donor. DESIGN: Organ donor and all transplant recipient medical records were reviewed. Laboratory tests to detect rabies virus-specific binding antibodies, rabies virus neutralizing antibodies, and rabies virus antigens were conducted on available specimens, including serum, cerebrospinal fluid, and tissues from the donor and the recipients. Viral ribonucleic acid was extracted from tissues and amplified for nucleoprotein gene sequencing for phylogenetic comparisons. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Determination of whether the donor died from undiagnosed rabies and whether other organ recipients developed rabies. RESULTS: In retrospect, the donor's clinical presentation (which began with vomiting and upper extremity paresthesias and progressed to fever, seizures, dysphagia, autonomic dysfunction, and brain death) was consistent with rabies. Rabies virus antigen was detected in archived autopsy brain tissue collected from the donor. The rabies viruses infecting the donor and the deceased kidney recipient were consistent with the raccoon rabies virus variant and were more than 99.9% identical across the entire N gene (1349/1350 nucleotides), thus confirming organ transplantation as the route of transmission. The 3 other organ recipients remained asymptomatic, with rabies virus neutralizing antibodies detected in their serum after completion of postexposure prophylaxis (range, 0.3-40.8 IU/mL). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Unlike the 2 previous clusters of rabies virus transmission through solid organ transplantation, there was a long incubation period in the recipient who developed rabies, and survival of 3 other recipients without pretransplant rabies vaccination. Rabies should be considered in patients with acute progressive encephalitis of unexplained etiology, especially for potential organ donors. A standard evaluation of potential donors who meet screening criteria for infectious encephalitis should be considered, and risks and benefits for recipients of organs from these donors should be evaluated.",

        "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to assess whether asthma onset prior to entering the workforce influences whether a person holds a subsequent job with asthma-related inhalation exposures. The data of 19,784 adults from the European Community Respiratory Health Survey were analysed. For each respondent, a current or previously held job was linked to a job exposure matrix assigning high, low or no exposure to dust, gases or fumes. Jobs were also categorised according to the risk of exposures related to occupational asthma. Associations between asthma and subsequent occupational exposures were assessed using logistic regression models, with a random intercept for study centre and fixed adjustment for age, sex, type of study sample and smoking status. Of the respondents, 8% (n = 1,619) reported asthma with onset before completion of full-time education. This population was at decreased risk of having a job with high (odds ratio 0.79; 95% confidence interval 0.68-0.92) or low (0.91; 0.80-1.03) exposure to dust, gases or fumes. The associations were consistent across exposure types (dusts, gases or fumes) and for jobs with a high risk of occupational asthma. Adults with asthma onset prior to entering the workforce may be less likely to hold jobs involving inhalation exposures.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Bisphenol A (BPA), an endocrine-disrupting chemical that is routinely detected in > 90% of Americans, promotes experimental asthma in mice. The association of prenatal BPA exposure and wheeze has not been evaluated in humans. OBJECTIVE: We examined the relationship between prenatal BPA exposure and wheeze in early childhood. METHODS: We measured BPA concentrations in serial maternal urine samples from a prospective birth cohort of 398 mother-infant pairs and assessed parent-reported child wheeze every 6 months for 3 years. We used generalized estimating equations with a logit link to evaluate the association of prenatal urinary BPA concentration with the dichotomous outcome wheeze (wheeze over the previous 6 months). RESULTS: Data were available for 365 children; BPA was detected in 99% of maternal urine samples during pregnancy. In multivariable analysis, a one-unit increase in log-transformed creatinine-standardized mean prenatal urinary BPA concentration was not significantly associated with child wheeze from birth to 3 years of age, but there was an interaction of BPA concentration with time (p = 0.003). Mean prenatal BPA above versus below the median was positively associated with wheeze at 6 months of age [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 2.3; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.3, 4.1] but not at 3 years (AOR = 0.6; 95% CI: 0.3, 1.1). In secondary analyses evaluating associations of each prenatal BPA concentration separately, urinary BPA concentrations measured at 16 weeks gestation were associated with wheeze (AOR = 1.2; 95% CI: 1.0, 1.5), but BPA concentrations at 26 weeks of gestation or at birth were not. CONCLUSIONS: Mean prenatal BPA was associated with increased odds of wheeze in early life, and the effect diminished over time. Evaluating exposure at each prenatal time point demonstrated an association between wheeze from 6 months to 3 years and log-transformed BPA concentration at 16 weeks gestation only.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To identify factors associated with prevalent HIV in a national HIV survey in Kenya. METHODS: The Kenya AIDS Indicator Survey was a nationally representative population-based sero-survey that examined demographic and behavioral factors and serologic testing for HIV, HSV-2 and syphilis in adults aged 15-64 years. We analyzed questionnaire and blood testing data to identify significant correlates of HIV infection among sexually active adults. RESULTS: Of 10,957 eligible women and 8,883 men, we interviewed 10,239 (93%) women and 7,731 (87%) men. We collected blood specimens from 9,049 women and 6,804 men of which 6,447 women and 5,112 men were sexually active during the 12 months prior to the survey. HIV prevalence among sexually active adults was 7.4%. Factors independently associated with HIV among women were region (Nyanza vs Nairobi: adjusted OR [AOR] 1.6, 95%CI 1.1-2.3), number of lifetime sex partners (6-9 vs 0-1 partners: AOR 3.0, 95%CI 1.6-5.9), HSV-2 (AOR 6.5, 95%CI 4.9-8.8), marital status (widowed vs never married: AOR 2.7, 95%CI 1.5-4.8) and consistent condom use with last sex partner (AOR 2.3, 95%CI 1.6-3.4). Among men, correlates of HIV infection were 30-to-39-year-old age group (AOR 5.2, 95%CI 2.6-10.5), number of lifetime sex partners (10+ vs 0-1 partners, AOR 3.5, 95%CI 1.4-9.0), HSV-2 (AOR 4.7, 95%CI 3.2-6.8), syphilis (AOR 2.4, 95%CI 1.4-4.0), consistent condom use with last sex partner (AOR 2.1, 95% CI 1.5-3.1) and lack of circumcision (AOR 4.0, 95%CI 2.8 - 5.5). CONCLUSION: Kenya's heterogeneous epidemic will require regional and gender-specific prevention approaches.",

        "abstract": "Men who have sex with men (MSM) are a crucial and marginalized at risk population for HIV in Africa but are poorly studied. Like other areas of Africa, homosexuality is illegal in Kenya. We assessed MSM comfort in accessing health services and willingness to participate in HIV prevention research in Kisumu, Kenya-an area of high HIV prevalence. We conducted a two-phase formative study with individual interviews (n = 15) and a structured survey (n = 51). Peer contact or snowball method (n = 43, 84.3%) was the primary recruitment strategy used to locate MSM. Exact logistic regression models were used for survey data analysis. Over 60% (32/51) of survey participants were not very comfortable seeking health services from a public hospital. Almost all MSM (49/51; 96.1%) reported willingness to be contacted to participate in future HIV research studies. Efforts to provide facilities that offer safe and confidential health services and health education for MSM is required. Continued community engagement with the MSM population in Kenya is needed to guide best practices for involving them in HIV prevention research.",

        "abstract": "In the US, application of antibody-based and nucleic acid testing for HCV has dramatically reduced HCV transmissions over the past two decades. In addition to testing donors of blood, tissue and organs to reduce the risk of transfusion/transplantation-associated HCV, testing can also motivate individuals to adopt safer behaviours. HCV testing, when accompanied by appropriate care and treatment, can reduce the extent of morbidity and mortality that often accompanies chronic HCV infection. Options for HCV treatment have recently been expanded and improved with the availability of more effective, anti-HCV drugs; furthermore, the remarkable results of clinical trials of these drugs suggest that safe, all-oral therapies requiring relatively short duration are on the immediate horizon. These advances have prompted new US initiatives to recommend HCV testing to the wider community (including those populations with a high prevalence of hepatitis C) and promote linkage to treatment for those found to be HCV-infected. Crucial to the success of these initiatives are the development of tests capable of identifying active infection, recent infection, or both, and the implementation of testing strategies that facilitate broad access to HCV testing linked to care and treatment.",

METHODS: Whole stool was collected from patients presenting to a hospital cholera ward during a 2008 epidemic in Guinea-Bissau. The VC test on stool samples was conducted on-site; samples were subsequently stored in Cary-Blair transport media and sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for diagnostic testing by culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In addition, four local laboratory technicians who were unfamiliar with the test were provided with stool samples, the VC test kit, and simple written instructions and asked to perform the test and interpret results. RESULTS: A total of 101 stool specimens were collected and tested. Compared with PCR, the test was 97% sensitive and 71-76% specific. Laboratory technicians in Bissau performed the test and interpreted results correctly using only simple written instructions. CONCLUSIONS: The VC test may be useful for cholera diagnosis in outbreak situations where laboratory capacity is limited.",

        "abstract": "Mycoplasma pneumoniae is an important respiratory pathogen, accounting for up to 25% of community-acquired pneumonia, and is a common cause of hospitalized pneumonia in otherwise healthy adults and children. Mycoplasma pneumoniae isolates can be classified into two main genomic groups (type 1 and type 2) based on sequence variation within the gene encoding the major adhesion molecule P1. Although numerous publications have described real-time PCR assays for the detection of M. pneumoniae, none has been able to discriminate the two genomic types. Here, a real-time PCR assay that can distinguish each type of M. pneumoniae utilizing high-resolution melt-curve analysis is reported. Using this method, 102 isolates obtained from patients from 1965 to the present, including those from recent outbreaks, were typed along with reference strains M129 (type 1) and FH (type 2). The results show that 55 isolates (54%) can be classified as type 1 and 47 isolates (46%) as type 2, and 100% correlation was demonstrated when compared with a standard PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism typing procedure. Typing of isolates obtained from recent outbreaks in the USA has revealed the presence of both types. This assay provides a rapid, reliable and convenient method for typing M. pneumoniae isolates and may be useful for surveillance purposes and epidemiological investigations, and may provide insight into the biology of M. pneumoniae distribution within populations.",

Ticks were collected from livestock, identified to species, pooled, and processed for virus isolation. In Garissa, Rhipicephalus pulchellus Gerstacker (57.8%) and Hyalomma truncatum Koch (27.8%) were the most abundant species sampled, whereas R. pulchellus (80.4%) and Amblyomma gemma Donitz (9.6%) were the most abundant in Isiolo. Forty-four virus isolates, comprising Dugbe virus (DUGV; n = 22) and Kupe virus (n = 10; Bunyaviridae: Nirovirus), Dhori virus (DHOV; n = 10; Orthomyxoviridae: Thogotovirus), and Ngari virus (NRIV; n = 2; Bunyaviridae: Orthobunyavirus), were recovered mostly from R. pulchellus sampled in Isiolo. DUGV was mostly recovered from R. pulchellus from sheep and cattle, and DHOV from R. pulchellus from sheep. All Kupe virus isolates were from Isiolo ticks, including R. pulchellus from all the livestock, A. gemma and Amblyomma variegatum F. from cattle, and H. truncatum from goat. NRIV was obtained from R. pulchellus and A. gemma sampled from cattle in Isiolo and Garissa, respectively, while all DHOV and most DUGV (n = 12) were from R. pulchellus sampled from cattle in Garissa. DUGV was also recovered from H. truncatum and Amblyomma hebraeum Koch from cattle and from Rhipicephalus annulatus Say from camel. This surveillance study has demonstrated the circulation of select tick-borne viruses in parts of eastern and northeastern provinces of Kenya, some of which are of public health importance. The isolation of NRIV from ticks is particularly significant because it is usually known to be a mosquito-borne virus affecting humans.",

Gains in quality-adjusted life-years are used to assess the cost-effectiveness of prophylactic use of clotting factor compared with on-demand treatment among people with hemophilia, a congenital bleeding disorder. Published estimates of health utilities for people with hemophilia vary, contributing to uncertainty in the estimates of cost-effectiveness of prophylaxis. Challenges in estimating utility weights for the purpose of evaluating hemophilia treatment include selection bias in observational data, difficulty in adjusting for predictors of health-related quality of life and lack of preference-based data comparing adults with lifetime or primary prophylaxis versus no prophylaxis living within the same country and healthcare system.",

Although the percent of daily calories derived from added sugars declined between 1999-2000 and 2007-2008, consumption of added sugars remains high in the diets of Americans. The 2010 Dietary Guidelines recommend limiting total intake of discretionary calories, which include added sugars and solid fats, to 5%-15% of daily caloric intake, yet many Americans continue to exceed these recommendations.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Screening for obesity and providing appropriate obesity-related counseling in the clinical setting are important strategies to prevent and control childhood obesity. The purpose of this study is to document pediatricians (PEDs) and general practitioners (GPs) with pediatric patients use of BMI-for-age to screen for obesity, confidence in explaining BMI, access to referral clinics, and characteristics associated with screening and counseling to children and their caregivers. METHODS: The authors used 2008 DocStyles survey data to examine these practices at every well child visit for children aged two years and older. Counseling topics included: physical activity, TV viewing time, energy dense foods, fruits and vegetables, and sugar-sweetened beverages. Chi-square tests were used to examine differences in proportions and logistic regression to identify characteristics associated with screening and counseling. RESULTS: The final analytic sample included 250 PEDs and 621 GPs. Prevalence of using BMI-for-age to screen for obesity at every well child visit was higher for PEDs than GPs (50% vs. 22%, chi(2) = 67.0, p </= 0.01); more PEDs reported being very/somewhat confident in explaining BMI (94% vs. GPs, 87%, p < 0.01); more PEDs reported access to a pediatric obesity specialty clinic for referral (PEDs = 65% vs. GPs = 42%, chi(2) = 37.5, p </= 0.0001).In general, PEDs reported higher counseling prevalence than GPs. There were significant differences in the following topics: TV viewing (PEDs, 79% vs. GPs, 61%, chi(2) = 19.1, p </= 0.0001); fruit and vegetable consumption (PEDs, 87% vs. GPs, 78%, chi(2) = 6.4, p </= 0.01). The only characteristics associated with use of BMI for GPs were being female (OR = 2.3, 95% CI = 1.5-3.5) and serving mostly non-white patients (OR = 1.8, 95% CI = 1.1-2.9); there were no significant associations for PEDs. CONCLUSIONS: The findings for use of BMI-for-age, counseling habits, and access to a pediatric obesity specialty clinic leave room for improvement. More research is needed to better understand why BMI-for-age is not being used to screen at every well child visit, which may increase the likelihood overweight and obese patients receive counseling and referrals for additional services. The authors also suggest more communication between PEDs and GPs through professional organizations to increase awareness of existing resources, and to enhance access and referral to pediatric obesity specialty clinics.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Poliovirus importations and related outbreaks continue to occur in polio-free countries, including those in the World Health Organization (WHO) European Region. National preparedness plans for responding to poliovirus introduction are insufficient in many countries of the European Region. We describe a series of polio outbreak simulation exercises that were implemented to formally test polio outbreak preparedness plans in the European Region. METHODS: We designed and implemented the exercises, reviewed the results, made recommendations, and assessed the role of outbreak simulation exercises in maintaining regional polio-free status. In addition, we performed a comprehensive review of the national plans of all WHO Member States in the European Region. RESULTS: Three exercises, delivered during 2011-2013 (for the Balkans, United Kingdom, and the Caucasus and Ukraine), revealed that participating countries were generally prepared for poliovirus introduction, but the level of preparedness needed improvement. The areas in particular need of strengthening were national preparedness plans, initial response, plans for securing vaccine supply, and communications. CONCLUSIONS: Polio outbreak simulation exercises can be valuable tools to help maintain polio-free status and should be extended to other high-risk countries and subnational areas in the European Region and elsewhere.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the level of informed choice in women invited for breast cancer screening for the first time. METHODS: To determine the content of decision-relevant knowledge, 16 experts were asked to judge whether each of 51 topics represented essential information to enable informed choices. To assess the level of informed choices, a questionnaire was then sent to all 460 invited women in the south-western part of the Netherlands who turned 50 in August 2008. RESULTS: Of all 229 respondents, 95% were deemed to have sufficient knowledge as they answered at least 8 out of 13 items correctly. In 90% there was consistency between intention (not) to participate and attitude. As a result, 88% made an informed choice. Sixty-eight percent of women responded correctly on the item of over-diagnosis. Even if all non-respondents were assumed to have no knowledge, 50% of the total group invited to participate still had sufficient knowledge. CONCLUSIONS: Women were deemed to have sufficient relevant knowledge of the benefits and harms if they answered at least half of the items correctly. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: To further increase informed choices in breast cancer screening, information on some of the possible harms merits further attention.",

        "abstract": "The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (hereafter NICE) was created in 1998 to give guidance on which treatments should be provided by the British National Health Service, and to whom. So it has a crucial role as an agent of distributive justice. In this paper I argue that it is failing to adequately explain and justify its decisions in the public arena, particularly in terms of distributive justice; and that this weakens its legitimacy, to the detriment of the National Health Service as a whole. I argue that this failure arises from the fact that NICE works within the frameworks of positivist science and liberal ethics, largely to the exclusion of other perspectives. This narrowness of view prevents NICE from properly connecting with the range of moral concerns represented in the population. I argue for NICE's deliberations to become more inclusive, both in terms of epistemology, and also in terms of ethical perspectives. And I suggest a range of perspectives that could usefully be included. Finally I offer a framework of structures, philosophies and discussion process that will enable competing perspectives to be debated fairly and productively in this process.",

METHODS: Generalized estimating equations were used to calculate the odds of depression or falls in participants with self-reported inadequate natural residential light vs. those reporting adequate light (n = 6,017) using data from the World Health Organization's Large Analysis and Review of European Housing and Health Survey, a large cross-sectional study of housing and health in representative populations from eight European cities. RESULTS: Participants reporting inadequate natural light in their dwellings were 1.4 times (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2,1.7) as likely to report depression and 1.5 times (95% CI 1.2, 1.9) as likely to report a fall compared with those satisfied with their dwelling's light. After adjustment for major confounders, the likelihood of depression changed slightly, while the likelihood of a fall increased to 2.5 (95% CI 1.5, 4.2). CONCLUSION: Self-reported inadequate light in housing is independently associated with depression and falls. Increasing light in housing, a relatively inexpensive intervention, may improve two distinct health conditions.",

        "abstract": "The etiology of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) is for the majority of cases unknown and more studies of risk factors are needed. Geographic variation in ASD occurrence has been observed, and urban residence has been suggested to serve as a proxy for etiologic and identification factors in ASD. We examined the association between urbanicity level and ASD at birth and during childhood. The study used a Danish register-based cohort of more than 800,000 children of which nearly 4,000 children were diagnosed with ASD. We found a dose-response association with greater level of urbanicity and risk of ASD. This association was found for residence at birth as well as residence during childhood. Further, we found an increased risk of ASD in children who moved to a higher level of urbanicity after birth. Also, earlier age of ASD diagnosis in urban areas was observed. While we could not directly examine the specific reasons behind these associations, our results demonstrating particularly strong associations between ASD diagnosis and post-birth migration suggest the influence of identification-related factors such as access to services might have a substantive role on the ASD differentials we observed.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: We sought to describe differences between normal weight, overweight, and obese adults in use of specific prescription medication classes. METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis of prescription medication use among 9789 adults in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a nationally representative sample of the United States. RESULTS: In 2005-2008, 56.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 54.6-58.3) of adults used 1+ prescription medication. Approximately one-quarter of adults used a hypertension medication (26.1%; 95% CI, 24.5%-27.8%). The use of hypertension medications increased with increasing weight status (normal weight: 17.2%; 95% CI, 15.6%-18.8%; overweight: 24.5%, 95% CI, 22.6%-26.4%; and obese: 35.1%, 95% CI, 32.8%-37.4%). Similarly, lipid-lowering, analgesic, antidepressant, proton pump inhibitors, thyroid, diabetes, and bronchodilator medication use was greater among obese compared with normal weight adults (each p < .01). Among adults 65+ years, 72% (95% CI, 68.2%-75.8%) of men and 67.7% (95% CI, 64.3%-71.2%) of women used a hypertension medication and a majority of men (51.2%, 95% CI, 48.4%-54%) and 40.3% (95% CI, 36.8%-43.8%) of women used lipid lowering medications; the use of both was greater among obese adults compared to normal weight adults (both p < .01). CONCLUSIONS: Obese adults in the United States use several prescription medication classes more frequently, than normal weight adults, including hypertension, lipid-lowering, and diabetes medications.",

        "abstract": "Following a radiation emergency, evacuated, sheltered or other members of the public would require monitoring for external and/or internal contamination and, if indicated, decontamination. In addition, the potentially-impacted population would be identified for biodosimetry/bioassay or needed medical treatment (chelation therapy, cytokine treatment, etc.) and prioritized for follow-up. Expeditious implementation of these activities presents many challenges, especially when a large population is affected. Furthermore, experience from previous radiation incidents has demonstrated that the number of people seeking monitoring for radioactive contamination (both external and internal) could be much higher than the actual number of contaminated individuals. In the United States, the Department of Health and Human Services is the lead agency to coordinate federal support for population monitoring activities. Population monitoring includes (1) monitoring people for external contamination; (2) monitoring people for internal contamination; (3) population decontamination; (4) collecting epidemiologic data regarding potentially exposed and/or contaminated individuals to prioritize the affected population for limited medical resources; (5) administering available pharmaceuticals for internal decontamination as deemed necessary by appropriate health officials; (6) performing dose reconstruction; and (7) establishing a registry to conduct long-term monitoring of this population for potential long-term health effects. This paper will focus on screening for internal contamination and will describe the use of early epidemiologic data as well as direct bioassay techniques to rapidly identify and prioritize the affected population for further analysis and medical attention.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine whether improper high-level disinfection practices during endoscopy procedures resulted in bloodborne viral infection transmission. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Four Veterans Affairs medical centers (VAMCs). PATIENTS: Veterans who underwent colonoscopy and laryngoscopy (ear, nose, and throat [ENT]) procedures from 2003 to 2009. METHODS: Patients were identified through electronic health record searches and serotested for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and hepatitis B virus (HBV). Newly discovered case patients were linked to a potential source with known identical infection, whose procedure occurred no more than 1 day prior to the case patient's procedure. Viral genetic testing was performed for case/proximate pairs to determine relatedness. RESULTS: Of 10,737 veterans who underwent endoscopy at 4 VAMCs, 9,879 patients agreed to viral testing. Of these, 90 patients were newly diagnosed with 1 or more viral bloodborne pathogens (BBPs). There were no case/proximate pairings found for patients with either HIV or HBV; 24 HCV case/proximate pairings were found, of which 7 case patients and 8 proximate patients had sufficient viral load for further genetic testing. Only 2 of these cases, both of whom underwent laryngoscopy, and their 4 proximates agreed to further testing. None of the 4 remaining proximate patients who underwent colonoscopy agreed to further testing. Mean genetic distance between the 2 case patients and 4 proximate patients ranged from 13.5% to 19.1%. CONCLUSIONS: Our investigation revealed that exposure to improperly reprocessed ENT endoscopes did not result in viral transmission in those patients who had viral genetic analysis performed. Any potential transmission of BBPs from colonoscopy remains unknown.",

Thus, the Office of the US Global AIDS Coordinator, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Becton, Dickinson and Company developed a public-private partnership (PPP). Between October 2007 and July 2012, the PPP combined the competencies of the public and private sectors to boost sustainable laboratory systems and develop workforce skills in 4 African countries. Key accomplishments of the initiative include measurable and scalable outcomes to strengthen national capacities to build technical skills, develop sample referral networks, map disease prevalence, support evidence-based health programming, and drive continuous quality improvement in laboratories.

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Using nationally representative data, we assessed the prevalence and correlates of cigarette smokers who tried switching to smokeless tobacco (SLT) or to other combusted tobacco (OCT) products to quit. METHODS: Data came from 12,400 current or former adult smokers who made a quit attempt in the past year and responded to the 2010-2011 Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey. Demographics and smoking characteristics were computed among those switching to SLT, switching to OCT, or trying to quit without using either strategy. Bivariate and multinomial logistic regression models identified correlates of using each strategy. RESULTS: Overall, 3.1% of smokers tried switching to SLT to quit, 2.2% tried switching to OCT, and 0.6% tried both strategies. Compared to those not using either switching strategy to try to quit, males were more likely than females to try switching to SLT or OCT; Blacks were less likely than Whites to try switching to SLT, but more likely to try switching to OCT; younger age groups were more likely to try switching to SLT or OCT; current someday smokers were more likely to have try switching to SLT (vs. everyday smokers), while recent former smokers were more likely to have tried switching to OCT. Both switching groups were more likely to have used cessation medication versus those not using switching strategies. CONCLUSION: Data suggest that switching to other tobacco products is a prevalent cessation approach; messages are needed to help clinicians encourage smokers who try to quit by switching to use evidence-based cessation approaches.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Serious psychological distress (SPD) is associated with adverse health outcomes such as poor quality of life and shorter survival in cancer survivors, but to the authors' knowledge, the relationship between SPD and health care use and medical expenditures is not clear. METHODS: A total of 4326 cancer survivors and 57,109 noncancer participants were identified from the 2008 through 2010 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, a nationwide population-based survey, and their psychological distress was assessed with the 6-item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (SPD defined by a score >/=13). The association between SPD and use and medical expenditures of various types of health care (office-based, outpatient, hospital inpatient, emergency department, dental, and prescriptions) was examined using a 2-part modeling approach that adjusted for demographic, personal, and comorbidity factors. The marginal effects of SPD on health care use and expenditures were calculated for cancer survivors and were compared with those of noncancer participants. RESULTS: The weighted prevalence of SPD in cancer survivors was 8.2% compared with 4.8% in the noncancer participants. SPD was significantly associated with higher use of all care types except dental care in cancer survivors. Cancer survivors with SPD spent $4431 (95% confidence interval, $3419-$5443) more than survivors without SPD on medical services each year, whereas this extra expenditure associated with SPD for participants without cancer was $2685 (95% confidence interval, $2099-$3271). CONCLUSIONS: In a national representative sample of cancer survivors, SPD was found to be associated with higher health care use and medical expenditures. Distress screening and psychosocial care in cancer survivors may help reduce the economic burden of cancer in the United States.",

In comparison to seasonal influenza viruses of lesser virulence, the 1918 H1N1 virus has fewer glycosylation sequons on the HA globular head region. Using site-directed mutagenesis we found that a 1918 HA recombinant virus, of high virulence, could be significantly attenuated in mice by adding two additional glycosylation sites (asparagine [Asn] 71 and Asn 286) on the side of the HA head. The 1918 HA recombinant virus was further attenuated by introducing two additional glycosylation sites on the top of the HA head at Asn 142 and Asn 172. In a reciprocal experimental approach, deletion of HA glycosylation sites (Asn 142 and Asn 177, but not Asn 71 and Asn 104) from a seasonal influenza H1N1 virus, A/Solomon Islands/2006 (SI/06) displayed increased virulence in mice. The addition of glycosylation sites to the 1918 HA and removal of glycosylation sites from SI/06 HA imposed constraints on the theoretical structure surrounding the glycan-receptor binding sites, which in turn led to distinct glycan receptor binding properties. The modification of glycosylation sites for the 1918 and SI/06 virus also caused changes in viral antigenicity based on cross hemagglutinin-inhibition antibody titers with antisera from mice infected with wild type or glycan mutant viruses. These results demonstrate that glycosylation patterns of the 1918 and seasonal H1N1 virus directly contributes to differences in virulence and is partially responsible for their distinct antigenicity.",

        "abstract": "The pandemic H1N1 virus of 2009 (2009 H1N1) continues to cause illness worldwide, primarily in younger age groups. To better understand the pathogenesis of these viruses in mammals, we used a mouse model to evaluate the relative virulence of selected 2009 H1N1 viruses and compared them to a representative human triple-reassortant swine influenza virus that has circulated in pigs in the United States for over a decade preceding the current pandemic. Additional comparisons were made with the reconstructed 1918 virus, a 1976 H1N1 swine influenza virus, and a highly pathogenic H5N1 virus. Mice were inoculated intranasally with each virus and monitored for morbidity, mortality, viral replication, hemostatic parameters, cytokine production and lung histology. All 2009 H1N1 viruses replicated efficiently in the lungs of mice and possessed a high degree of infectivity, but did not cause lethal disease or exhibit extrapulmonary virus spread. Transient weight loss, lymphopenia, and proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine production were present following 2009 H1N1 virus infection, but these levels were generally muted compared with a triple-reassortant swine virus and the 1918 virus. 2009 H1N1 viruses isolated from fatal cases did not demonstrate enhanced virulence in this model compared with isolates from mild human cases. Histologically, infection with the 2009 viruses resulted in lesions in the lung varying from mild to moderate bronchiolitis with occasional necrosis of bronchiolar epithelium, and mild to moderate peribronchiolar alveolitis. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that the 2009 H1N1 viruses exhibited mild to moderate virulence in mice compared with highly pathogenic viruses.",

However, recent data indicate that both genotypes can be transmitted among humans through other routes (2,3). Observations of genetic distinctiveness between swine and human HEV strains circulating within the same region argue against exclusivity of zoonotic transmission (4).

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Few studies report the effectiveness of trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) in preventing hospitalisation for influenza-confirmed respiratory infections. Using a prospective surveillance platform, this study reports the first such estimate from a well-defined ethnically diverse population in New Zealand (NZ). METHODS: A case test-negative design was used to estimate propensity adjusted vaccine effectiveness. Patients with a severe acute respiratory infection (SARI), defined as a patient of any age requiring hospitalisation with a history of a fever or a measured temperature >/=38 degrees C and cough and onset within the past 7 days, admitted to public hospitals in South and Central Auckland were eligible for inclusion in the study. Cases were SARI patients who tested positive for influenza, while non-cases (controls) were SARI patients who tested negative. Results were adjusted for the propensity to be vaccinated and the timing of the influenza season. RESULTS: The propensity and season adjusted vaccine effectiveness (VE) was estimated as 39% (95% CI 16;56). The VE point estimate against influenza A (H1N1) was lower than for influenza B or influenza A (H3N2) but confidence intervals were wide and overlapping. Estimated VE was 59% (95% CI 26;77) in patients aged 45-64 years but only 8% (-78;53) in those aged 65 years and above. CONCLUSION: Prospective surveillance for SARI has been successfully established in NZ. This study for the first year, the 2012 influenza season, has shown low to moderate protection by TIV against influenza positive hospitalisation.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) are new manufactured nanomaterials with a wide spectrum of commercial applications. The durability and fiber-like dimensions (mean length 3.9 mum long x 49 nm diameter) of MWCNT suggest that these fibers may migrate to and have toxicity within the pleural region. To address whether the pleura received a significant and persistent exposure, C57BL/6J mice were exposed by pharyngeal aspiration to 10, 20, 40 and 80 mug MWCNT or vehicle and the distribution of MWCNT penetrations determined at 1, 7, 28 and 56 days after exposure. Following lung fixation and sectioning, morphometric methods were used to determine the distribution of MWCNT and the number of MWCNT fiber penetrations of three barriers: alveolar epithelium (alveolar penetrations), the alveolar epithelium immediately adjacent to the pleura (subpleural tissue), and visceral pleural surface (intrapleural space). RESULTS: At 1 day 18%, 81.6% and 0.6% of the MWCNT lung burden was in the airway, the alveolar, and the subpleural regions, respectively. There was an initial, high density of penetrations into the subpleural tissue and the intrapleural space one day following aspiration which appeared to decrease due to clearance by alveolar macrophages and/or lymphatics by day 7. However, the density of penetrations increased to steady state levels in the subpleural tissue and intrapleural from day 28 - 56. At day 56 approximately 1 in every 400 fiber penetrations was in either the subpleural tissue or intrapleural space. Numerous penetrations into macrophages in the alveolar airspaces throughout the lungs were demonstrated at all times but are not included in the counts presented. CONCLUSIONS: The results document that MWCNT penetrations of alveolar macrophages, the alveolar wall, and visceral pleura are both frequent and sustained. In addition, the findings demonstrate the need to investigate the chronic toxicity of MWCNT at these sites.",

        "abstract": "A critical need exists for efficacious interventions to reduce sexual risk and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among African American girls in juvenile detention. Adapting evidence-based interventions is one strategy for developing interventions that might protect detained African American girls from adverse sexual health outcomes. To support development and implementation of evidence-based HIV/STI prevention interventions for this population, this qualitative study describes lessons learned from delivering Imara, an adapted HIV/STI prevention intervention for detained African American girls. Program implementation includes one-on-one sessions in the detention facility that offer logistical advantages; provide intervention contact inside the facility, soon after release, and frequently thereafter; address STI treatment for girls and their sexual partners; tailor intervention content based on individual risk and learning needs; and identify and acknowledge girls' competing priorities. These lessons are discussed in the context of challenges encountered and solutions for addressing the challenges, and in terms of the structure and content of the intervention. The lessons learned from delivering Imara exemplify the continuous process of adapting an existing intervention for a new population and setting.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has recommended routine human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination at age 11 or 12 years for girls since 2006 and for boys since 2011. We sought to describe adolescent HPV vaccination coverage, doses administered from 2009 to 2012, and age at first vaccination by sex. METHODS: Aggregate data were analyzed from 8 Immunization Information System sentinel sites on HPV vaccinations in children and adolescents aged 11 to 12 years, 13 to 15 years, and 16 to 18 years. Vaccination coverage by age group was reported for 2009 to 2012, and weekly doses administered were determined. Age at first HPV vaccination was calculated for girls in 2007 and 2011 and for boys in 2011. RESULTS: This analysis included data on 2.9 million adolescents aged 11 to 18 years. There were small increases in coverage for girls, with receipt of >/=1 dose of HPV vaccine reaching 27.1% of ages 11 to 12, 47.9% of ages 13 to 15, and 57.1% of ages 16 to 18 by December 31, 2012. Uptake of >/=1 dose in boys reached approximately 18% for all age groups. Doses administered showed seasonal variation, with highest uptake before back to school among girls and steady increases in boys after the 2009 ACIP recommendation for permissive use. Doses administered to boys surpassed those administered to girls by September 2012. Among vaccinated girls, more received vaccine at the recommended age of 11 to 12 years in 2011 (74.2%) compared to 2007 (9.9%). In 2011, 27.3% of vaccinated boys received their first dose at age 11 to 12 years. CONCLUSIONS: HPV vaccination coverage increased among adolescents between 2009 and 2012. However, increases among girls were small, and coverage for boys and girls remained below target levels.",

The Nutrition Report presents data on blood and urine biomarker concentrations (selected water- and fat-soluble vitamins and nutrients, trace elements, dietary bioactive compounds) from a representative sample of the population participating in the NHANES. The Second Nutrition Report (released in 2012) contains reference information (means and percentiles) for 58 biomarkers measured during all or part of 2003-2006, stratified by age, sex, and race-ethnicity. Where available, we presented cutoff-based prevalence data during 2003-2006 and data on changes in biomarker concentrations or prevalence since 1999. Blood vitamin concentrations were generally higher in older (>/=60 y) than in younger (20-39 y) adults and lower in Mexican Americans and non-Hispanic blacks than in non-Hispanic whites. Nearly 80% of Americans (aged >/=6 y) were not at risk of deficiencies in any of the 7 vitamins studied (vitamins A, B-6, B-12, C, D, and E and folate). Deficiency rates varied by age, sex, and race-ethnicity. Approximately 90% of women (aged 12-49 y) were not at risk of iron deficiency, but only 68% were not at risk of deficiencies in iron and all 7 vitamins. Young women (20-39 y) had median urine iodine concentrations bordering on insufficiency. First-time data are presented on plasma concentrations of 24 saturated and mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Tabulation and graphical presentation of NHANES data in the Second Nutrition Report benefits those organizations involved in developing and evaluating nutrition policy.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: We estimated the population-based incidence of maternal and neonatal mortality associated with hepatitis E virus (HEV) in Bangladesh. METHODS: We analyzed verbal autopsy data from 4 population-based studies in Bangladesh to calculate the maternal and neonatal mortality ratios associated with jaundice during pregnancy. We then reviewed the published literature to estimate the proportion of maternal deaths associated with liver disease during pregnancy that were the result of HEV in hospitals. RESULTS: We found that 19% to 25% of all maternal deaths and 7% to 13% of all neonatal deaths in Bangladesh were associated with jaundice in pregnant women. In the published literature, 58% of deaths in pregnant women with acute liver disease in hospitals were associated with HEV. CONCLUSIONS: Jaundice is frequently associated with maternal and neonatal deaths in Bangladesh, and the published literature suggests that HEV may cause many of these deaths. HEV is preventable, and studies to estimate the burden of HEV in endemic countries are urgently needed. (Am J Public Health.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Mumps outbreaks have been reported among vaccinated populations, and declining mumps vaccine effectiveness (VE) has been suggested as one possible cause. During a large mumps outbreak in New York City, we assessed: (1) VE of measles-mumps-rubella vaccine (MMR) against mumps and (2) risk factors for acquiring mumps in households. METHODS: Cases of mumps were investigated using standard methods. Additional information on disease and vaccination status of household contacts was collected. Case households completed follow-up phone interviews 78-198 days after initial investigation to ascertain additional cases. Mumps cases meeting the study case definition were included in the analysis. Risk factors for mumps were assessed, and VE was calculated using secondary household attack rates. RESULTS: Three hundred and eleven households with 2176 residents were included in the analysis. The median age of residents was 13 years (range <1-85), and 462 (21.2%) residents met the study mumps case definition. Among 7-17 year olds, 89.7% received one or more doses of MMR vaccine, with 76.7% receiving two doses. Young adults aged 10-14 years (OR=2.4, CI=1.3-4.7) and 15-19 years (OR=2.5, CI=1.3-5.0) were at highest risk of mumps. The overall 2-dose VE for secondary contacts aged five and older was 86.3% (CI 63.3-94.9). CONCLUSIONS: The two-dose effectiveness of MMR vaccine against mumps was 86.3%, consistent with other published mumps VE estimates. Many factors likely contributed to this outbreak. Suboptimal MMR coverage in the affected population combined with VE may not have conferred adequate immunity to prevent transmission and may have contributed to this outbreak. Achieving high MMR coverage remains the best available strategy for prevention of mumps outbreaks.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Car seats should be used to prevent injury or death in children during motor vehicle crashes. When used improperly or for unintended purposes, car seats can place children at risk for injury or death. The objective of this article is to describe patterns of hazardous use of car seats outside the car for infants (<1-year-olds) in the United States from 2003 to 2007. METHODS: The National Electronic Injury Surveillance System of the US Consumer Product Safety Commission database was accessed to obtain information regarding car seat-related injuries treated in emergency departments from 2003 to 2007. Injuries sustained during motor vehicle crashes were excluded. Demographic data, type of injury, body location, disposition, injury circumstances, and other pertinent information were extracted and analyzed. RESULTS: An estimated 43562 car seat-related injuries were treated in emergency departments from 2003 to 2007. This national estimate was based on a weighted sample of 1898 infants. The average age of these infants was 4.07 +/- 2.73 months, 62.4% of the injuries occurred in infants younger than 4 months, and 54.4% occurred in boys. Of these injuries, 49.1% occurred at home, 8.4% of the infants had to be hospitalized, and 84.3% of the infants suffered a head injury. The most common mechanisms of injury were infants falling from car seats, car seats falling from elevated surfaces, and car seats overturning on soft surfaces. CONCLUSIONS: Injury-prevention efforts should be focused on eliminating hazardous use of car seats outside the car. Caregivers should be cautioned against the placement of car seats on elevated or soft surfaces.",

OBJECTIVES: To present the most recent estimates of obesity prevalence in US children and adolescents for 2009-2010 and to investigate trends in obesity prevalence and body mass index (BMI) among children and adolescents between 1999-2000 and 2009-2010. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional analyses of a representative sample (N = 4111) of the US child and adolescent population (birth through 19 years of age) with measured heights and weights from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2009-2010. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of high weight-for-recumbent length (>/=95th percentile on the growth charts) among infants and toddlers from birth to 2 years of age and obesity (BMI >/=95th percentile of the BMI-for-age growth charts) among children and adolescents aged 2 through 19 years. Analyses of trends in obesity by sex and race/ethnicity, and analyses of trends in BMI within sex-specific age groups for 6 survey periods (1999-2000, 2001-2002, 2003-2004, 2005-2006, 2007-2008, and 2009-2010) over 12 years. RESULTS: In 2009-2010, 9.7% (95% CI, 7.6%-12.3%) of infants and toddlers had a high weight-for-recumbent length and 16.9% (95% CI, 15.4%-18.4%) of children and adolescents from 2 through 19 years of age were obese. There was no difference in obesity prevalence among males (P = .62) or females (P = .65) between 2007-2008 and 2009-2010. However, trend analyses over a 12-year period indicated a significant increase in obesity prevalence between 1999-2000 and 2009-2010 in males aged 2 through 19 years (odds ratio, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.01-1.10) but not in females (odds ratio, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.98-1.07) per 2-year survey cycle. There was a significant increase in BMI among adolescent males aged 12 through 19 years (P = .04) but not among any other age group or among females. CONCLUSION: In 2009-2010, the prevalence of obesity in children and adolescents was 16.9%; this was not changed compared with 2007-2008.",

        "abstract": "Excess intake of sodium, a common problem worldwide, is associated with hypertension and cardiovascular disease (CVD), and hypertension is a major risk factor for CVD. Population-wide efforts to reduce sodium intake have been identified as a promising strategy for preventing hypertension and CVD, and such initiatives are currently recommended by a variety of scientific and public health organizations. By reviewing the literature published from January 2011 to March 2013, we summarized recent economic analyses of interventions to reduce sodium intake. The evidence, derived from estimates of resultant blood pressure decreases and thus decreases in the incidence of CVD events, supports population-wide interventions for reducing sodium intake. Both lowering the salt content in manufactured foods and conducting mass media campaigns at the national level are estimated to be cost-effective in preventing CVD. Although better data on the cost of interventions are needed for rigorous economic evaluations, population-wide sodium intake reduction can be a promising approach for containing the growing health and economic burden associated with hypertension and its sequelae.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: In 2005, 4 Clostridium sordellii-associated toxic shock fatalities were reported in young Californian women after medical abortions. The true incidence of this rare disease is unknown, and a population-based study has never been performed. Additional clostridia-associated deaths were sought to describe associated clinical characteristics. STUDY DESIGN: Population-based death certificate review and a clinical case definition for clostridial-associated toxic shock identified women with likelihood of dying from a Clostridium infection. Formalin-fixed autopsy tissues underwent immunohistochemical and polymerase chain reaction assays. RESULTS: Thirty-eight women were suspected of having C sordellii-associated death. Five tested positive for Clostridium species: 3 for Clostridium perfringens, 1 for C sordellii, and 1 for both. Deaths occurred after the medical procedures for cervical dysplasia (n = 2), surgical abortion (n = 1), stillborn delivery (n = 1), and term live birth (n = 1). None had a medical abortion. CONCLUSION: C sordellii and C perfringens are associated with undiagnosed catastrophic infectious gynecologic illnesses among women of childbearing age.",

        "abstract": "Swine influenza viruses (SIV), have been shown to sporadically infect humans, and are infrequently identified by Influenza Division of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) after being received as unsubtypable influenza A virus samples. Real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) procedures for detection and characterization of North American lineage (N.Am) SIV were developed and implemented at CDC for rapid identification of specimens from cases of suspected infections with SIV. These procedures were utilized in April 2009 for detection of human cases of 2009 A (H1N1) pandemic (pdm) influenza virus infection. Based on genetic sequence data of the first two viruses, the previously developed rRT-PCR procedures were optimized to create the CDC rRT-PCR Swine Flu Panel for detection of the 2009 A (H1N1) pdm influenza virus. Analytical sensitivity of the CDC rRT-PCR Swine Flu Panel was shown to be 5 copies of RNA per-reaction and 10(-1.3 approximately -0.7) ID(50) per-reaction for cultured viruses. Cross reactivity was not observed when testing human clinical specimens or cultured viruses that were positive for human seasonal A (H1N1, H3N2) and B influenza viruses. The CDC rRT-PCR Swine Flu Panel was distributed to public health laboratories in the United States and internationally from April 2009 until June 2010. The CDC rRT-PCR Swine Flu Panel served as effective tool for timely and specific detection of 2009 A (H1N1) pdm influenza viruses and facilitated subsequent public health response implementation.",

        "abstract": "The Food and Drug Administration mandated that by 1998, all enriched cereal grain products (ECGP) be fortified with folic acid in order to prevent the occurrence of neural tube defects. The Institute of Medicine established the tolerable upper intake level (UL) for folic acid (1000 microg/day for adults) in 1998. We characterized U.S. adults with usual daily folic acid intake exceeding the UL. Using NHANES 2003-2010 data, we estimated the percentage of 18,321 non-pregnant adults with usual daily folic acid intake exceeding the UL, and among them, we calculated the weighted percentage by sex, age, race/ethnicity, sources of folic acid intake, supplement use and median usual daily folic acid intakes. Overall, 2.7% (standard error 0.6%) of participants had usual daily intake exceeding the UL for folic acid; 62.2% were women; 86.3% were non-Hispanic whites; and 98.5% took supplements containing folic acid. When stratified by sex and age groups among those with usual daily folic acid intake exceeding the UL, 20.8% were women aged 19-39 years. Those with usual daily intake exceeding the folic acid UL were more likely to be female, non-Hispanic white, supplement users or to have at least one chronic medical condition compared to those not exceeding the folic acid UL. Among those with usual daily folic acid intake exceeding the UL who also took supplements, 86.6% took on average >400 microg of folic acid/day from supplements. Everyone with usual daily folic acid intake exceeding the UL consumed folic acid from multiple sources. No one in our study population had usual daily folic acid intake exceeding the UL through consumption of mandatorily-fortified enriched cereal grain products alone. Voluntary consumption of supplements containing folic acid is the main factor associated with usual daily intake exceeding the folic acid UL.",

        "abstract": "Euler angle decomposition and inverse dynamics were used to determine the knee angles and net forces and moments applied to the tibia during kneeling and squatting with and without kneepads for 10 subjects in four postures: squatting (Squat), kneeling on the right knee (One Knee), bilateral kneeling near full flexion (Near Full) and bilateral kneeling near 90 degrees flexion (Near 90). Kneepads affected the knee flexion (p = .002), medial forces (p = .035), and internal rotation moments (p = .006). Squat created loading conditions that had higher varus (p < .001) and resultant moments (p = .027) than kneeling. One Knee resulted in the highest force magnitudes and net moments (p < .001) of the kneeling postures. Thigh-calf and heel-gluteus contact forces decreased the flexion moment on average by 48% during Squat and Near Full.",

This study examines the racial disparities in access to health care and preventive services between AAPIs and NHWs in the USA. METHODS: Cross-sectional study of access to health care and preventive services among AAPIs compared to NHWs, using data from Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System 2005 to 2007 among 908,154 respondents aged > or = 18 years. RESULTS: The percentages of AAPIs (aged > or = 18 years) who reported having a personal healthcare provider, a Pap test (women aged > or =18), a fecal occult blood test (aged > or = 50) a sigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy (aged > or = 50), a PSA test (men aged > or = 40), blood cholesterol checked (aged > or =18 yrs), and pneumococcal vaccination (aged > or = 65 yrs) were 76.7%, 83.1%, 27.5%, 47.5%, 35.5%, 74.2%, and 51.2%, respectively. Compared to NHWs, AAPIs were significantly less likely to have a personal health care provider (adjusted odds ratio: 0.69 [95% confidence interval: 0.63-0.75]), a Pap test (0.18 [0.13-0.28]), a fecal occult blood test (0.50 [0.39-0.631), a sigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy (0.64 [0.50-0.81]), a PSA test (0.35 [0.26-0.47]), blood cholesterol checked (0.71 [0.64-0.80]), and pneumococcal vaccination (0.52 [0.42-0.65]). CONCLUSION: This study suggests that disparities exist between AAPIs and NHWs in 1 of 4 selected health care access indicators and 6 of 8 selected preventive services.",

        "abstract": "One of the greatest challenges facing post-apartheid South Africa is the control of the concomitant HIV and tuberculosis epidemics. HIV continues to spread relentlessly, and tuberculosis has been declared a national emergency. In 2007, South Africa, with 0.7% of the world's population, had 17% of the global burden of HIV infection, and one of the world's worst tuberculosis epidemics, compounded by rising drug resistance and HIV co-infection. Until recently, the South African Government's response to these diseases has been marked by denial, lack of political will, and poor implementation of policies and programmes. Nonetheless, there have been notable achievements in disease management, including substantial improvements in access to condoms, expansion of tuberculosis control efforts, and scale-up of free antiretroviral therapy (ART). Care for acutely ill AIDS patients and long-term provision of ART are two issues that dominate medical practice and the health-care system. Decisive action is needed to implement evidence-based priorities for the control of the HIV and tuberculosis epidemics. By use of the framework of the Strategic Plans for South Africa for tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS, we provide prioritised four-step approaches for tuberculosis control, HIV prevention, and HIV treatment. Strong leadership, political will, social mobilisation, adequate human and financial resources, and sustainable development of health-care services are needed for successful implementation of these approaches.",

        "abstract": "To improve the reliability of the anti-vibration (AV) glove test defined in the current standard, a revised version of the standard has been proposed. However, the revised method has not been fully tested and sufficiently evaluated, and it is unknown whether it is practically feasible and convenient to implement the standard. To help achieve the objective of the revision, the specific aims of this study are to examine the rationale behind the major revisions of the standard and to evaluate the major technical aspects of the revised method through an experiment. Five human subjects participated in the experiment for the evaluation. Fifteen gloves with anti-vibration features were used in the experiment. To help evaluate the AV glove criteria, the effects of the glove on the grip strength were also examined. While this study failed to realize the constant-velocity spectrum proposed in the original revision, the glove vibration transmissibility values measured with a new spectrum proposed in the current study were very similar to those measured with the M and H spectra defined in the current standard, which suggests the new spectrum can greatly simplify the test without changing the original test results, and it should be adopted in the further revision of the standard. The results of this study also strongly support the proposed major revisions in the instrumentation and test procedures. Coincidently, the glove that reduced the grip strength the least was also the one that reduced the most vibration, which suggests that the negative and positive effects of the glove can be balanced in its design. While the subject is identified as a major influencing factor, this study proposed a novel approach - the use of a reference glove in the test to minimize the inter-subject and inter-laboratory variations. Based on the results of this study, some other further revisions in the test procedures, evaluation methods, and AV glove criteria were also proposed and discussed. Relevance to industry Anti-vibration gloves have been used as an alternative approach to reduce hand-transmitted vibration exposure. A standard is required to conduct a reliable screening test to help select appropriate anti-vibration gloves. This study can significantly help improve the current standard on the test. The results of this study can also be directly used to help select appropriate AV gloves.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to examine a large cohort of adults who received the zoster vaccine for evidence of an increased risk of pre-specified adverse events requiring medical attention. DESIGN: Two self-comparison approaches, including a case-centered approach and a self-controlled case series (SCCS) analysis were used. SETTING: Eight managed care organizations participating in the Vaccine Safety Datalink project in the United States. SUBJECTS: A total of 193,083 adults aged 50 and older receiving a zoster vaccine from January 1(st) 2007 to December 31(st) 2008 were included. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Pre-specified adverse events were identified by aggregated International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes in automated health plan datasets. RESULTS: The risk of allergic reaction was significantly increased within 1-7 days of vaccination (relative risk =2.13, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.87-2.40 by case-centered method and relative rate=2.32, 95% CI: 1.85-2.91 by SCCS). No increased risk was found for the following adverse event groupings: cerebrovascular events; cardiovascular events; meningitis, encephalitis, and encephalopathy; and Ramsay-Hunt syndrome and Bell's palsy. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study support the findings from the pre-licensure clinical trials, providing reassurance that the zoster vaccine is generally safe and well tolerated with a small increased risk of allergic reactions in 1-7 days after vaccination.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: This article examines the association between the New York City regulations on beverages served in child care centers and beverage consumption among enrolled children. The regulations include requirements related to beverages served to children throughout the day. METHODS: Beverage consumption data were collected on 636 children enrolled in 106 group child care centers in New York City. Data on compliance with the regulations were collected through direct observation, interviews with center staff, and a site inventory. Logistic regression for rare events was used to test associations between compliance with the regulations and beverage consumption. RESULTS: Compliance with the regulations was associated with lower odds of children consuming milk with more than 1% fat content and sugar-sweetened beverages during meals and snacks. There was not a significant relationship between compliance with the regulations and children's consumption of water. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest a strong, direct relationship between what a center serves and what a child consumes, particularly regarding consumption of higher-fat milk and sugar-sweetened beverages. Therefore, policies governing the types of beverages served in child care centers may increase children's consumption of more healthful beverages and reduce the consumption of less healthful ones.",

        "abstract": "CONTEXT: More than 5000 ambulatory surgical centers (ASCs) in the United States participate in the Medicare program. Little is known about infection control practices in ASCs. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) piloted an infection control audit tool in a sample of ASC inspections to assess facility adherence to recommended practices. OBJECTIVE: To describe infection control practices in a sample of ASCs. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: All State Survey Agencies were invited to participate. Seven states volunteered; 3 were selected based on geographic dispersion, number of ASCs each state committed to inspect, and relative cost per inspection. A stratified random sample of ASCs was selected from each state. Sample size was based on the number of inspections each state estimated it could complete between June and October 2008. Sixty-eight ASCs were assessed; 32 in Maryland, 16 in North Carolina, and 20 in Oklahoma. Surveyors from CMS, trained in use of the audit tool, assessed compliance with specific infection control practices. Assessments focused on 5 areas of infection control: hand hygiene, injection safety and medication handling, equipment reprocessing, environmental cleaning, and handling of blood glucose monitoring equipment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportion of facilities with lapses in each infection control category. RESULTS: Overall, 46 of 68 ASCs (67.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 55.9%-77.9%) had at least 1 lapse in infection control; 12 of 68 ASCs (17.6%; 95% CI, 9.9%-28.1%) had lapses identified in 3 or more of the 5 infection control categories. Common lapses included using single-dose medication vials for more than 1 patient (18/64; 28.1%; 95% CI, 18.2%-40.0%), failing to adhere to recommended practices regarding reprocessing of equipment (19/67; 28.4%; 95% CI, 18.6%-40.0%), and lapses in handling of blood glucose monitoring equipment (25/54; 46.3%; 95% CI, 33.4%-59.6%). CONCLUSION: Among a sample of US ASCs in 3 states, lapses in infection control were common.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: National data on health care use among children with special needs are limited and do not address children with spina bifida (SB). One recent study examined health care costs during 2003 among privately insured individuals with SB. Our objective was to compare health care use and expenditures among publicly insured children with SB to children without a major birth defect and among children with SB with and without hydrocephalus. METHODS: Data from the North Carolina Birth Defects Monitoring Program and Medicaid were linked to identify continuously enrolled children with SB (case children) and children without a major birth defect (control children) born from 1995 to 2002. Medicaid expenditures per child for medical, inpatient, outpatient, dental, well-child care, developmental/behavioral services, and home health for those aged 0 to 4 years old were calculated for case and control children and for case children with and without hydrocephalus. RESULTS: Of 373 case children who survived infancy, 205 (55%) were enrolled in Medicaid. Expenditures were assessed for 144 case and 5674 control children aged 0 to 4 years old continuously enrolled in Medicaid. During infancy, mean expenditure was $33,135 per child with SB and $3900 per unaffected child. The biggest relative expenditures were for developmental/behavioral services (82 times higher for case than control child [$1401 vs. $17]) and home health services (20 times higher [$821 vs. $41]). Average expenditure for an infant with SB and hydrocephalus was 2.6 times higher than an infant with SB without hydrocephalus ($40,502 vs. $15,699). CONCLUSIONS: Expenditure comparisons by SB subtype are important for targeting health care resources. (Birth Defects Research (Part A), 2011. (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.)",

        "abstract": "The Information Technology (IT) roadmap for personalized medicine requires Electronic Health Records (EHRs), extension of Healthcare IT (HIT) standards, and understanding of how genetics/genomics should be integrated into the clinical applications. For reduced overall costs and development times, these three initiatives should run in parallel. EHRs must contain structured data and infrastructure which enables quality analysis, Clinical Decision Support (CDS) and messaging within the healthcare information network. Fortunately, as a result of sustained financial commitment to non-genetic based healthcare, the industry has HIT data standards and understanding of EHR functionality which improves patient safety and outcomes, while reducing overall healthcare costs. However, the HIT standards and EHR functional requirements, needed for personalized medicine, are only beginning to support simple genetic tests and need significant extension. In addition, our understanding of the clinical implications of genomic data is evolving and translation of new discovery into clinical care remains a challenge. Therefore priority areas include CDS, educational resources and knowledgebases for the EHR, clinical and research data warehouses, messaging frameworks, and continued review of healthcare policies and regulations supporting personalized medicine. Where core infrastructure remains to be developed and implemented, funding is needed for pilot projects, data standards, policy, and stakeholder collaboration. (c) 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

        "abstract": "The authors examined the association between prescribed medications and fatal motor vehicle crashes (MVCs) in an active duty military population between 2002 and 2006. Using a case-control design, MVC deaths were ascertained using a military mortality registry, and an integrated health system database provided information on health system eligibility, pharmacy transactions, and medical encounters. Cases and controls were matched on comparable observation time outside periods of deployment. Among selected categories, only one, antidepressant medications, was an independent predictor of fatal MVC (odds ratio, 3.19; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-10.07). Male gender, Black race, enlisted rank, service branch (Navy and Marine Corps), and selected co-morbidities were also independent predictors. Unexpectedly, the odds of younger age quartiles (< 27 years) and history of deployment were reduced for MVC cases. Although results need to be considered in the context of data limitations, the association between prescribed antidepressants and fatal MVC may reflect unmeasured co-morbidities, such as combined effects of prescribed and over-the-counter medications and/or alcohol or other substance abuse. Younger individuals, representing new military accessions in training or returning from deployment with serious injuries, may have fewer opportunities to operate vehicles, or targeted efforts to reduce MVC following deployment may be showing a positive effect.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Several studies have implicated viral infection as an important factor in the pathogenesis of IPF and related fibrotic lung disorders. Viruses are thought to cause epithelial cell injury and promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process whereby differentiated epithelial cells undergo transition to a mesenchymal phenotype, and considered a source of fibroblasts in the setting of lung injury. We have demonstrated an association between the epithelial injury caused by chronic herpes virus infection with the murine gamma-herpes virus, MHV68, and lung fibrosis. We hypothesize that EMT in this model of virus-induced pulmonary fibrosis is driven by the expression of the transcription factor Twist. METHODS/FINDINGS: In vitro MHV68 infection of murine lung epithelial cells induced expression of Twist, and mesenchymal markers. Stable overexpression of Twist promoted EMT in MLE15 lung epithelial cells. Transient knockdown expression of Twist resulted in preservation of epithelial phenotype after in vitro MHV68 infection. In concordance, high expression of Twist was found in lung epithelial cells of MHV68 infected mice, but not in mock infected mice. Alveolar epithelial cells from lung tissue of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) patients were strongly positive for Twist. These cells demonstrated features of EMT with low expression of E-cadherin and upregulation of the mesenchymal marker N-cadherin. Finally, IPF tissue with high Twist protein levels was also positive for the herpesvirus, EBV. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We conclude that Twist contributes to EMT in the model of virus-induced pulmonary fibrosis. We speculate that in some IPF cases, gamma-herpes virus infection with EBV might be a source of injury precipitating EMT through the expression of Twist.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: We implemented a chlamydia screening program targeted at young women accessing reproductive health care services in a school-based setting, and we assessed racial/ethnic factors associated with infection. METHODS: The California Family Health Council partnered with 9 health care agencies receiving federal Title X family planning funding and 19 educational institutions to implement the Educational Partnerships to Increase Chlamydia Screening (EPICS) program from January 2008 through December 2008. RESULTS: EPICS agencies provided reproductive health services to 3396 unique sexually active females, 85% of whom self-reported no other source for reproductive health care. Chlamydia screening was provided to 3026 clients (89.1% chlamydia screening coverage). Of those screened for chlamydia, 5.6% tested positive. Clients who were African American (odds ratio [OR]=7.5; 95% confidence interval [CI]=3.9, 14.3), Pacific Islander (OR=4.1; 95% CI=1.1, 15.5), or Asian (OR=3.3; 95% CI=1.4, 8.1) were more likely to have a positive test than were White clients. CONCLUSIONS: Chlamydia screening programs implemented in school-based settings have the capacity to identify and treat a significant amount of asymptomatic infection in a population that otherwise may not be reached. To facilitate screening, school-based clinics should implement outreach strategies that target their school population and clinical strategies that maximize opportunities for screening.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: We investigated the relationship between parental incarceration history and young adult physical and mental health outcomes using Wave 1 and Wave 4 data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. METHODS: Dependent variables included self-reported fair/poor health and health diagnoses. The independent variable was parental incarceration history. Cross-tabulations and logistic regression models were run. RESULTS: Positive, significant associations were found between parental incarceration and 8 of 16 health problems (depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety, cholesterol, asthma, migraines, HIV/AIDS, and fair/poor health) in adjusted logistic regression models. Those who reported paternal incarceration had increased odds of 8 mental and physical health problems, whereas those who reported maternal incarceration had increased odds of depression. For paternal incarceration, with the exception of HIV/AIDS, larger associations were found for mental health (odds ratios range 1.43-1.72) as compared with physical health (odds ratios range 1.26-1.31) problems. The association between paternal incarceration and HIV/AIDs should be interpreted with caution because of the low sample prevalence of HIV/AIDs. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests exposure to parental incarceration in childhood is associated with health problems in young adulthood. Extant literature suggests underlying mechanisms that link parental incarceration history to poor outcomes in offspring may include the lack of safe, stable, nurturing relationships and exposure to violence. To prevent poor health in offspring of the incarcerated, additional studies are needed to (1) confirm the aforementioned associations and (2) assess whether adverse experiences and violence exposure in childhood mediate the relationship between parental incarceration history and offspring health problems.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study assessed reporting behavior and satisfaction with postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) systems among health care workers (HCWs) at risk for occupational bloodborne pathogen exposure (BPE) in 3 public hospitals in Botswana. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey among HCWs provided information on perceptions, attitudes, and experiences with occupational exposures, reporting, and postexposure care. HCWs potentially in contact with blood or body fluids were surveyed using audio computer-assisted self-interview. RESULTS: Between August 2012 and April 2013, 1,624 HCWs completed the survey; most were women (72%), and almost half (48%) were nurses. Sixty-seven percent of them had ever received training related to BPE management; 62% perceived themselves to be at high risk for BPE. Among the 426 HCWs who were exposed to sharps injuries or splashes in the last 6 months, 160 (37%) reported the exposure. Of these, 111 of the 160 (69%) received PEP, and 79 of the 111 (71%) completed their medication. Whereas >92% of the total HCWs had ever been tested for HIV, only 557 (37%) were tested in their own health facility. Most HCWs (87%, n = 1,406) reported they would be interested in testing themselves. Of HCWs who reported an exposure, less than half (49%, n = 78) were satisfied with existing reporting systems. CONCLUSIONS: Underreporting of occupational exposures and dissatisfaction with PEP management is common among HCWs. Improved PEP management strategies and regular monitoring are needed.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Productivity losses can arise when employees miss work to seek care for sexually transmissible infections (STIs). We estimated the average productivity loss per acute case of four nonviral STIs: chlamydia, gonorrhoea, syphilis and trichomoniasis. METHODS: We extracted outpatient claims from 2001-2005 MarketScan databases using International Classification Disease ver. 9 (ICD-9) codes. We linked claims with their absence records in the Health and Productivity Management database by matching enrolee identifiers and the service dates from the claims such that our final data included only those who were absent because they were sick and were diagnosed with an STI on the day of their visit. To ensure that the visit was for the STIs being examined, we restricted the criteria to records with the specified ICD-9 codes only, excluding claims with other codes. We estimated the average number of hours absent and multiplied it by the mean hourly wage rate including benefits ($29.72 in 2011 United States dollars) to estimate the average productivity loss per case. RESULTS: The average productivity losses per case were: $262 for chlamydia, $197 for gonorrhoea, $419 for syphilis and $289 for trichomoniasis. There were no significant differences between males and females. CONCLUSIONS: Among those who take sick leave to seek care, productivity losses associated with treating nonviral STIs may be higher than their estimated direct medical costs. These productivity cost estimates can help to quantify the overall STI burden, and inform cost-effectiveness analyses of prevention and control efforts.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Demand-side strategies could contribute to achieving high and timely vaccine coverage in rural Africa, but require platforms to deliver either messages or conditional cash transfers (CCTs). We studied the feasibility of using short message services (SMS) reminders and mobile phone-based conditional cash transfers (CCTs) to reach parents in rural Western Kenya. METHODS: In a Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS), mothers with children aged 0-3 weeks old were approached to determine who had access to a mobile phone. SMS reminders were sent three days prior to and on the scheduled day of immunization for 1st (age 6 weeks) and 2nd doses (age 10 weeks) of DTP-HepB-Hib (Pentavalent) vaccine, using open-source Rapid SMS software. Approximately $2.00 USD was sent as cash using mPESA, a mobile money transfer platform (2/3 of mothers), or airtime (1/3 of mothers) via phone if the child was vaccinated within 4 weeks of the scheduled date. Follow-up surveys were done when children reached 14 weeks of age. RESULTS: We approached 77 mothers; 72 were enrolled into the study (26% owned a phone and 74% used someone else's). Of the 63 children with known vaccination status at 14 weeks of age, 57 (90%) received pentavalent1 and 54 (86%) received pentavalent2 within 4 weeks of their scheduled date. Of the 61 mothers with follow-up surveys administered at 14 weeks of age, 55 (90%) reported having received SMS reminders. Of the 54 women who reported having received SMS reminders and answered the CCT questions on the survey, 45 (83%) reported receiving their CCT. Most (89%) of mothers in the mPESA group obtained their cash within 3 days of being sent their credit via mobile phone. All mothers stated they preferred CCTs as cash via mobile phone rather than airtime. Of the 9 participants who did not vaccinate their children at the designated clinic 2(22%) cited refusals by husbands to participate in the study. CONCLUSION: The data show that in rural Western Kenya mobile phone-based strategies are a potentially useful platform to deliver reminders and cash transfers. Follow-up studies are needed that provide evidence for the effectiveness of these strategies in improving vaccine coverage and timeliness.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Prior annualized estimates of pediatric ischemic stroke incidence have ranged from 0.54 to 1.2 per 100 000 US children but relied purely on diagnostic code searches to identify cases. We sought to obtain a new estimate using both diagnostic code searches and searches of radiology reports and to assess the relative value of these 2 strategies. METHODS: Using the population of 2.3 million children ( 20 years old) enrolled in a Northern Californian managed care plan (1993 to 2003), we performed electronic searches of (1) inpatient and outpatient diagnoses for International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision codes suggestive of stroke and cerebral palsy; and (2) radiology reports for key words suggestive of infarction. Cases were confirmed through chart review. We calculated sensitivities and positive predictive values for the 2 search strategies. RESULTS: We identified 1307 potential cases from the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision code search and 510 from the radiology search. A total of 205 ischemic stroke cases were confirmed, yielding an ischemic stroke incidence of 2.4 per 100,000 person-years. The radiology search had a higher sensitivity (83%) than the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision code search (39%), although both had low positive predictive values. For perinatal stroke, the sensitivity of the stroke International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision codes alone was 12% versus 57% for stroke and cerebral palsy codes combined; the radiology search was again the most sensitive (87%). CONCLUSIONS: Our incidence estimate doubles that of prior US reports, a difference at least partially explained by our use of radiology searches for case identification. Studies relying purely on International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision code searches may underestimate childhood ischemic stroke rates, particularly for neonates.",

        "abstract": "This study examines a national survey of U.S. health journalists (N = 774) to ascertain how journalists' perceptions of audience use of health news shapes their journalistic practices. We establish a framework through attribution theory and expectancy-value theory for how journalists choose to fulfill their roles as providers of health information. Using these theoretical lenses, we look at whether health journalists' audience orientation is associated with their use of accessibility-oriented or credibility-focused practices. Our findings show that, overall, journalists believe readers are individually responsible for their health outcomes and that journalists focus on providing accessibility-oriented information when they feel their audience's ability to understand information may be compromised. Journalists' beliefs about audience behavior are associated with their attitudes toward communication practices.",

        "abstract": "Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 is endemic in Vietnamese poultry and has caused sporadic human infection in Vietnam since 2003. Human infections with HPAI H5N1 are of concern due to a high mortality rate and the potential for the emergence of pandemic viruses with sustained human-to-human transmission. Viruses isolated from humans in southern Vietnam have been classified as clade 1 with a single genome constellation (VN3) since their earliest detection in 2003. This is consistent with detection of this clade/genotype in poultry viruses endemic to the Mekong River Delta and surrounding regions. Comparison of H5N1 viruses detected in humans from southern Vietnamese provinces during 2012 and 2013 revealed the emergence of a 2013 reassortant virus with clade 1.1.2 hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) surface protein genes but internal genes derived from clade 2.3.2.1a viruses (A/Hubei/1/2010-like; VN12). Closer analysis revealed mutations in multiple genes of this novel genotype (referred to as VN49) previously associated with increased virulence in animal models and other markers of adaptation to mammalian hosts. Despite the changes identified between the 2012 and 2013 genotypes analyzed, their virulence in a ferret model was similar. Antigenically, the 2013 viruses were less cross-reactive with ferret antiserum produced to the clade 1 progenitor virus, A/Vietnam/1203/2004, but reacted with antiserum produced against a new clade 1.1.2 WHO candidate vaccine virus (A/Cambodia/W0526301/2012) with comparable hemagglutination inhibition titers as the homologous antigen. Together, these results indicate changes to both surface and internal protein genes of H5N1 viruses circulating in southern Vietnam compared to 2012 and earlier viruses.",

        "abstract": "To clarify phylogenetic relationships and genetic diversity among Bartonella washoensis strains obtained from squirrels, multi-locus sequence analysis (MLSA) with the 16S rRNA, ftsZ, gltA, groEL, ribC, and rpoB genes was applied for 20 strains of B. washoensis isolated from five genera of squirrels (Tamias, Tamiasciurus, Glaucomys, Sciurus, and Spermophilus) within the family Sciuridae. Sequence similarities in the concatenated sequences of B. washoensis strains from squirrels of different genera ranged from 94.7% (Sciurus vs. Spermophilus) to 98.4% (Tamiasciurus vs. Glaucomys). Phylogenetic trees based on the concatenated sequences revealed that B. washoensis strains formed five distinct clades and each clade correlated with the genus of squirrel from which the strains were originally obtained. The discrimination was supported by 100% bootstrap values and posterior probabilities, respectively. These results suggest that B. washoensis strains may have co-speciated with their squirrel hosts and provide new insights into the application of the MLSA to identify sources of B. washoensis infection with accuracy.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess the performance and impact of primary human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA screening with cytology triage compared with conventional cytology on cervical cancer and severe pre-cancerous lesions. DESIGN: Randomised trial. SETTING: Population based screening programme for cervical cancer in southern Finland in 2003-5. PARTICIPANTS: 58 076 women, aged 30-60, invited to the routine population based screening programme for cervical cancer. INTERVENTIONS: Primary HPV DNA test (hybrid capture II) with cytology triage if the result was positive or conventional cytological screening (reference). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rate of cervical cancer, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade III, and adenocarcinoma in situ (as a composite outcome referred to as CIN III+) during 2003-7 through record linkage between files from the screening registry and the national cancer registry. RESULTS: In the HPV and conventional arms there were 95 600 and 95 700 woman years of follow-up and 76 and 53 cases of CIN III+, respectively (of which six and eight were cervical cancers). The relative rate of CIN III+ in the HPV arm versus the conventional arm was 1.44 (95% confidence interval 1.01 to 2.05) among all women invited for screening and 1.77 (1.16 to 2.74) among those who attended. Among women with a normal or negative test result, the relative rate of subsequent CIN III+ was 0.28 (0.04 to 1.17). The rate of cervical cancer between arms was 0.75 (0.25 to 2.16) among women invited for screening and 1.98 (0.52 to 9.38) among those who attended. CONCLUSIONS: When incorporated into a well established organised screening programme, primary HPV screening with cytology triage was more sensitive than conventional cytology in detecting CIN III+ lesions. The number of cases of cervical cancer was small, but considering the high probability of progression of CIN III the findings are of importance regarding cancer prevention.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The estimated number of new HIV infections in the United States reflects the leading edge of the epidemic. Previously, CDC estimated HIV incidence in the United States in 2006 as 56,300 (95% CI: 48,200-64,500). We updated the 2006 estimate and calculated incidence for 2007-2009 using improved methodology. METHODOLOGY: We estimated incidence using incidence surveillance data from 16 states and 2 cities and a modification of our previously described stratified extrapolation method based on a sample survey approach with multiple imputation, stratification, and extrapolation to account for missing data and heterogeneity of HIV testing behavior among population groups. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Estimated HIV incidence among persons aged 13 years and older was 48,600 (95% CI: 42,400-54,700) in 2006, 56,000 (95% CI: 49,100-62,900) in 2007, 47,800 (95% CI: 41,800-53,800) in 2008 and 48,100 (95% CI: 42,200-54,000) in 2009. From 2006 to 2009 incidence did not change significantly overall or among specific race/ethnicity or risk groups. However, there was a 21% (95% CI:1.9%-39.8%; p = 0.017) increase in incidence for people aged 13-29 years, driven by a 34% (95% CI: 8.4%-60.4%) increase in young men who have sex with men (MSM). There was a 48% increase among young black/African American MSM (12.3%-83.0%; p<0.001). Among people aged 13-29, only MSM experienced significant increases in incidence, and among 13-29 year-old MSM, incidence increased significantly among young, black/African American MSM. In 2009, MSM accounted for 61% of new infections, heterosexual contact 27%, injection drug use (IDU) 9%, and MSM/IDU 3%. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Overall, HIV incidence in the United States was relatively stable 2006-2009; however, among young MSM, particularly black/African American MSM, incidence increased. HIV continues to be a major public health burden, disproportionately affecting several populations in the United States, especially MSM and racial and ethnic minorities. Expanded, improved, and targeted prevention is necessary to reduce HIV incidence.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The U.S. diet is high in salt, with the majority coming from processed foods. Reducing dietary salt is a potentially important target for the improvement of public health. METHODS: We used the Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) Policy Model to quantify the benefits of potentially achievable, population-wide reductions in dietary salt of up to 3 g per day (1200 mg of sodium per day). We estimated the rates and costs of cardiovascular disease in subgroups defined by age, sex, and race; compared the effects of salt reduction with those of other interventions intended to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease; and determined the cost-effectiveness of salt reduction as compared with the treatment of hypertension with medications. RESULTS: Reducing dietary salt by 3 g per day is projected to reduce the annual number of new cases of CHD by 60,000 to 120,000, stroke by 32,000 to 66,000, and myocardial infarction by 54,000 to 99,000 and to reduce the annual number of deaths from any cause by 44,000 to 92,000. All segments of the population would benefit, with blacks benefiting proportionately more, women benefiting particularly from stroke reduction, older adults from reductions in CHD events, and younger adults from lower mortality rates. The cardiovascular benefits of reduced salt intake are on par with the benefits of population-wide reductions in tobacco use, obesity, and cholesterol levels. A regulatory intervention designed to achieve a reduction in salt intake of 3 g per day would save 194,000 to 392,000 quality-adjusted life-years and $10 billion to $24 billion in health care costs annually. Such an intervention would be cost-saving even if only a modest reduction of 1 g per day were achieved gradually between 2010 and 2019 and would be more cost-effective than using medications to lower blood pressure in all persons with hypertension. CONCLUSIONS: Modest reductions in dietary salt could substantially reduce cardiovascular events and medical costs and should be a public health target.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This paper analyses helmet use before and after implementing Helmets for Kids, a school-based helmet distribution and road safety programme in Cambodia. METHODS: Nine intervention schools (with a total of 6721 students) and four control schools (with a total of 3031 students) were selected using purposive sampling to target schools where students were at high risk of road traffic injury. Eligible schools included those where at least 50% of students commute to school on bicycles or motorcycles, were located on a national road (high traffic density), had few or no street signs nearby, were located in an area with a history of crash injuries and were in a province where other Cambodia Helmet Vaccine Initiative activities occur. Programme's effectiveness at each school was measured through preintervention and postintervention roadside helmet observations of students as they arrived or left school. Research assistants conducted observations 1-2 weeks preintervention, 1-2 weeks postintervention, 10-12 weeks postintervention and at the end of the school year (3-4 months postintervention). RESULTS: In intervention schools, observed student helmet use increased from an average of 0.46% at 1-2 weeks preintervention to an average of 87.9% at 1-2 weeks postintervention, 83.5% at 10-12 weeks postintervention and 86.5% at 3-4 months postintervention, coinciding with the end of the school year. Increased helmet use was observed in children commuting on bicycle or motorcycle, which showed similar patterns of helmet use. Helmet use remained between 0.35% and 0.70% in control schools throughout the study period. CONCLUSIONS: School-based helmet use programmes that combine helmet provision and road safety education might increase helmet use among children.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) may be the most important water-soluble antioxidant in human plasma. In the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III, 1988-1994), approximately 13% of the US population was vitamin C deficient (serum concentrations <11.4 mumol/L). OBJECTIVE: The aim was to determine the most current distribution of serum vitamin C concentrations in the United States and the prevalence of deficiency in selected subgroups. DESIGN: Serum concentrations of total vitamin C were measured in 7277 noninstitutionalized civilians aged >/=6 y during the cross-sectional, nationally representative NHANES 2003-2004. The prevalence of deficiency was compared with results from NHANES III. RESULTS: The overall age-adjusted mean from the square-root transformed (SM) concentration was 51.4 mumol/L (95% CI: 48.4, 54.6). The highest concentrations were found in children and older persons. Within each race-ethnic group, women had higher concentrations than did men (P < 0.05). Mean concentrations of adult smokers were one-third lower than those of nonsmokers (SM: 35.2 compared with 50.7 mumol/L and 38.6 compared with 58.0 mumol/L in men and women, respectively). The overall prevalence (+/-SE) of age-adjusted vitamin C deficiency was 7.1 +/- 0.9%. Mean vitamin C concentrations increased (P < 0.05) and the prevalence of vitamin C deficiency decreased (P < 0.01) with increasing socioeconomic status. Recent vitamin C supplement use or adequate dietary intake decreased the risk of vitamin C deficiency (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In NHANES 2003-2004, vitamin C status improved, and the prevalence of vitamin C deficiency was significantly lower than that during NHANES III, but smokers and low-income persons were among those at increased risk of deficiency.",

        "abstract": "Recent advances in instrumentation and data analysis in field flow fractionation and multi-angle light scattering (FFF-MALS) have enabled greater use of this technique to characterize and quantitate viruses. In this study, the FFF-MALS technique was applied to the characterization and quantitation of type A influenza virus particles to assess its usefulness for vaccine preparation. The use of FFF-MALS for quantitation and measurement of control particles provided data accurate to within 5% of known values, reproducible with a coefficient of variation of 1.9%. The methods, sensitivity and limit of detection were established by analyzing different volumes of purified virus, which produced a linear regression with fitting value R2 of 0.99. FFF-MALS was further applied to detect and quantitate influenza virus in the supernatant of infected MDCK cells and allantoic fluids of infected eggs. FFF fractograms of the virus present in these different fluids revealed similar distribution of monomeric and oligomeric virions. However, the monomer fraction of cell grown virus has greater size variety. Notably, beta-propialactone (BPL) inactivation of influenza viruses did not influence any of the FFF-MALS measurements. Quantitation analysis by FFF-MALS was compared to infectivity assays and real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and the limitations of each assay were discussed.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Multiple studies have yielded important findings regarding the determinants of an advanced-stage diagnosis of breast cancer. We seek to advance this line of inquiry through a broadened conceptual framework and accompanying statistical modeling strategy that recognize the dual importance of access-to-care and biological factors on stage. METHODS: The CDC-sponsored Breast and Prostate Cancer Data Quality and Patterns of Care Study yielded a 7-state, cancer registry-derived population-based sample of 9,142 women diagnosed with a first primary in situ or invasive breast cancer in 2004. The likelihood of advanced-stage cancer (AJCC IIIB, IIIIC, or IV) was investigated through multivariable regression modeling, with base-case analyses using the method of instrumental variables (IV) to detect and correct for possible selection bias. The robustness of base-case findings were examined through extensive sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Advanced-stage disease was negatively associated with detection by mammography (p<0.001) and age<50 (p<0.001), and positively related to black race (p=0.066), not being privately insured [Medicaid (p=0.012), Medicare (p=0.036), uninsured (p=0.069)], being single (p=0.058), BMI>40 (p<0.001), a HER2 Type tumor (p<0.001), and tumor grade not well differentiated (p<0.001). This IV model detected and adjusted for significant selection effects associated with method of detection (p=0.017). Sensitivity analyses generally supported these base-case results. CONCLUSIONS: Through our comprehensive modeling strategy and multiple sensitivity analyses, we provide new estimates of the magnitude and robustness of the determinants of advanced-stage breast cancer. IMPACT: Statistical approaches frequently used to address observational data biases in treatment-outcome studies can be applied similarly in analyses of the determinants of stage-at-diagnosis.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To describe the population uptake of HIV care including antiretroviral therapy (ART) and its impact on adult mortality in a rural area of western Kenya with high HIV prevalence during a period of rapid HIV services scale-up. DESIGN: Adult medical chart data were abstracted at health facilities providing HIV care/ART to residents of a Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) and linked with HDSS demographic and mortality data. METHODS: We evaluated secular trends in patient characteristics across enrollment years and estimated proportions of HIV-positive adult residents receiving care. We evaluated adult (18-64 years) population mortality trends using verbal autopsy findings. RESULTS: From 2003-2008, 5,421 HDSS-resident adults enrolled in HIV care; 61.4% (n = 3,331) were linked to HDSS follow-up data. As the number of facilities expanded from 1 (2003) to 17 (2008), receipt of HIV services by HIV-positive residents increased from <1% to 29.5%, andART coverage reached 64.0% of adults with CD4 <250. The proportion of patients with WHO stage 4 at enrolment fell from 20.4% to 1.9%, and CD4 testing at enrolment increased from 1.0% to 53.4%. Population-level mortality rates for adults declined 34% for allcauses, 26% for AIDS/tuberculosis, and 47% for other infectious diseases; non-infectious disease mortality rates remained constant. CONCLUSIONS: The initial years of rapid HIV service expansion coincided with a drop in adult mortality by a third. Continued expansion of population access to HIV clinical services, including ART, and program quality improvements will be necessary to achieve further progress in reducing HIV-related morbidity and mortality.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: During an influenza pandemic, a substantial proportion of transmission is thought to occur in households. We used data on influenza progression in individuals and their contacts collected by the City of Milwaukee Health Department (MHD) to study the transmission of pandemic influenza A/H1N1 virus in 362 households in Milwaukee, WI, and the effects of oseltamivir treatment and chemoprophylaxis. METHODS: 135 households had chronological information on symptoms and oseltamivir usage for all household members. The effect of oseltamivir treatment and other factors on the household secondary attack rate was estimated using univariate and multivariate logistic regression with households as the unit of analysis. The effect of oseltamivir treatment and other factors on the individual secondary attack rate was estimated using univariate and multivariate logistic regression with individual household contacts as the unit of analysis, and a generalized estimating equations approach was used to fit the model to allow for clustering within households. RESULTS: Oseltamivir index treatment on onset day or the following day (early treatment) was associated with a 42 percent reduction (OR: 0.58, 95 percent CI: 0.19, 1.73) in the odds of one or more secondary infections in a household and a 50 percent reduction (OR: 0.5, 95 percent CI: 0.17, 1.46) in the odds of a secondary infection in individual contacts. The confidence bounds are wide due to a small sample of households with early oseltamivir index usage - in 29 such households, 5 had a secondary attack. Younger household contacts were at higher risk of infection (OR: 2.79, 95 percent CI: 1.50-5.20). CONCLUSIONS: Early oseltamivir treatment may be beneficial in preventing H1N1pdm influenza transmission; this may have relevance to future control measures for influenza pandemics. Larger randomized trials are needed to confirm this finding statistically.",

Hawaii and Mississippi did not report any laboratory-confirmed rabid animals during 2010. Approximately 92% of reported rabid animals were wildlife. Relative contributions by the major animal groups were as follows: 2,246 raccoons (36.5%), 1,448 skunks (23.5%), 1,430 bats (23.2%), 429 foxes (6.9%), 303 cats (4.9%), 71 cattle (1.1 %), and 69 dogs (1.1 %). Compared with 2009, number of reported rabid animals decreased across all animal types with the exception of a 1 % increase in the number of reported rabid cats. Two cases of rabies involving humans were reported from Louisiana and Wisconsin in 2010. Louisiana reported an imported human rabies case involving a 19-year-old male migrant farm worker who had a history of a vampire bat (Desmodus rotundus) bite received while in Mexico. This represents the first human rabies case reported in the United States confirmed to have been caused by a vampire bat rabies virus variant. Wisconsin reported a human rabies case involving a 70-year-old male that was confirmed to have been caused by a rabies virus variant associated with tri-colored bats (Perimyotis subflavus).",

        "abstract": "Preterm birth affects 12.5% of all births in the USA. Infants of Black mothers are disproportionately affected, with 1.5 times the risk of preterm birth and 3.4 times the risk of preterm-related mortality. The preterm birth rate has increased by 33% in the last 25 years, almost entirely due to the rise in late preterm births (34-36 weeks' gestation). Recently attention has been given to uncovering the often subtle morbidity and mortality risks associated with moderate (32-33 weeks' gestation) and late preterm delivery, including respiratory, infectious, and neurocognitive complications and infant mortality. This section summarizes the epidemiology of moderate and late preterm birth, case definitions, risk factors, recent trends, and the emerging body of knowledge of morbidity and mortality associated with moderate and late preterm birth.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Prophylactic mastectomy, prophylactic oophorectomy, and antiestrogen chemoprevention are currently the only available methods for breast cancer risk reduction. To the authors' knowledge there is little published information regarding the prevalence of prophylactic mastectomy for the primary prevention of breast cancer among high-risk women or for the prevention of subsequent tumors among women with breast cancer. METHODS: The objective of the current study was to examine the frequency of prophylactic mastectomy in New York State between 1995 and 2005 using mandated statewide discharge data combined with data from the state cancer registry. RESULTS: Identified were 6275 female residents of New York State receiving prophylactic mastectomy; 19% had no identifiable personal history of breast cancer (including women with lobular carcinoma in situ) and 81% had a personal history of breast cancer (84% with invasive disease and 16% with ductal carcinoma in situ). The increased use of prophylactic mastectomy over time was found to be more pronounced among women with breast cancer compared with those without. Women who underwent prophylactic mastectomies were more likely to be younger and white and to have private insurance compared with women who underwent therapeutic mastectomies and compared with all women with breast cancer. The International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Edition, Clinical Modification diagnostic code for prophylactic mastectomy introduced in 1995 was found to have low sensitivity for identifying prophylactic mastectomies in coded discharge data. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current analysis demonstrate that, although the discharge data alone are inadequate for surveillance purposes, combining these data with the cancer registry data allowed for the detailed examination of the prevalence of prophylactic mastectomies. Mastectomy among high-risk women for cancer prevention appears to be relatively uncommon, but the use of contralateral mastectomy in women with breast cancer is increasing. Cancer 2009.

        "abstract": "Experiments with relatively high doses are often used to predict risks at appreciably lower doses.A point of departure (PoD) can be calculated as the dose associated with a specified moderate response level that is often in the range of experimental doses considered. A linear extrapolation to lower doses often follows.An alternative to the PoD method is to develop a model that accounts for the model uncertainty in the dose-response relationship and to use this model to estimate the risk at low doses.Two such approaches that account for model uncertainty are model averaging (MA) and semi-parametric methods.We use these methods, along with the PoD approach in the context of a large animal (40,000+ animal) bioassay that exhibited sub-linearity. When models are fit to high dose data and risks at low doses are predicted, the methods that account for model uncertainty produce dose estimates associated with an excess risk that are closer to the observed risk than the PoD linearization.This comparison provides empirical support to accompany previous simulation studies that suggest methods that incorporate model uncertainty provide viable, and arguably preferred, alternatives to linear extrapolation from a PoD.",

METHODS: The authors surveyed a probability sample of 1234 US HIV care providers on delivery of 9 sexual behavior- and 7 substance use-related HIV transmission RR services and created an indicator of \"adequate\" delivery of services in each area, defined as performing approximately 70% or more of applicable services. RESULTS: Providers were most likely to encourage patients to disclose HIV status to all partners since HIV diagnosis (81%) and least likely to ask about disclosure to new sex and drug injection partners at follow-up visits (both 41%). Adequate delivery of sexual behavior- and substance use-related RR services was low (37% and 43%, respectively). CONCLUSION: The majority of US HIV care providers may need additional support to improve delivery of comprehensive HIV transmission RR services.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Monitoring influenza virus susceptibility to neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors (NAIs) is vital for detecting drug-resistant variants, and is primarily assessed using NA inhibition (NI) assays, supplemented by NA sequence analysis. However, differences in NI testing methodologies between surveillance laboratories results in variability of 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values, which impacts data sharing, reporting and interpretation. In 2011, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in collaboration with the Association for Public Health Laboratories (APHL) spearheaded efforts to standardize fluorescence-based NI assay testing in the United States (U.S.), with the goal of achieving consistency of IC50 data. METHODS: For the standardization process, three participating state public health laboratories (PHLs), designated as National Surveillance Reference Centers for Influenza (NSRC-Is), assessed the NAI susceptibility of the 2011-12 CDC reference virus panel using stepwise procedures with support from the CDC reference laboratory. Next, the NSRC-Is assessed the NAI susceptibility of season 2011-12 U.S. influenza surveillance isolates (n=940), with a large subset (n=742) tested in parallel by CDC. Subsequently, U.S. influenza surveillance isolates (n=9629) circulating during the next three influenza seasons (2012-15), were independently tested by the three NSRC-Is (n=7331) and CDC (n=2298). RESULTS: The NI assay IC50s generated by respective NSRC-Is using viruses and drugs prepared by CDC were similar to those obtained with viruses and drugs prepared in-house, and were uniform between laboratories. IC50s for U.S. surveillance isolates tested during four consecutive influenza seasons (2011-15) were consistent from season to season, within and between laboratories. CONCLUSION: These results show that the NI assay is robust enough to be standardized, marking the first time IC50 data have been normalized across multiple laboratories, and used for U.S. national NAI susceptibility surveillance.",

        "abstract": "Adverse health effects caused by worker exposure to ultrafine particles have been detected in recent years. The scientific community focuses on the assessment of ultrafine aerosols in different microenvironments in order to determine the related worker exposure/dose levels. To this end, particle size distribution measurements have to be taken along with total particle number concentrations. The latter are obtainable through hand-held monitors. A portable particle size distribution analyzer (Nanoscan SMPS 3910, TSI Inc.) was recently commercialized, but so far no metrological assessment has been performed to characterize its performance with respect to well-established laboratory-based instruments such as the scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) spectrometer. The present paper compares the aerosol monitoring capability of the Nanoscan SMPS to the laboratory SMPS in order to evaluate whether the Nanoscan SMPS is suitable for field experiments designed to characterize particle exposure in different microenvironments. Tests were performed both in a Marple calm air chamber, where fresh diesel particulate matter and atomized dioctyl phthalate particles were monitored, and in microenvironments, where outdoor, urban, indoor aged, and indoor fresh aerosols were measured. Results show that the Nanoscan SMPS is able to properly measure the particle size distribution for each type of aerosol investigated, but it overestimates the total particle number concentration in the case of fresh aerosols. In particular, the test performed in the Marple chamber showed total concentrations up to twice those measured by the laboratory SMPS-likely because of the inability of the Nanoscan SMPS unipolar charger to properly charge aerosols made up of aggregated particles. Based on these findings, when field test exposure studies are conducted, the Nanoscan SMPS should be used in tandem with a condensation particle counter in order to verify and correct the particle size distribution data.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Maternal urinary biomarkers are often used to assess fetal exposure to phenols and their precursors. Their effectiveness as a measure of exposure in epidemiological studies depends on their variability during pregnancy and their ability to accurately predict fetal exposure.OBJECTIVES: We assessed the relationship between urinary and amniotic fluid concentrations of nine environmental phenols, and the reproducibility of urinary concentrations, among pregnant women.METHODS: Seventy-one women referred for amniocentesis were included. Maternal urine was collected at the time of the amniocentesis appointment and on two subsequent occasions. Urine and amniotic fluid were analyzed for 2,4- and 2,5-dichlorophenols, bisphenol A, benzophenone-3, triclosan, and methyl-, ethyl-, propyl-, and butylparabens using online solid phase extraction-high performance liquid chromatography-isotope dilution tandem mass spectrometry.RESULTS: Only benzophenone-3 and propylparaben were detectable in more than half of the amniotic fluid samples; for these phenols, concentrations in amniotic fluid and maternal urine collected on the same day were positively correlated (rho = 0.53 and 0.32, respectively). Other phenols were detected infrequently in amniotic fluid (e.g., bisphenol A was detected in only two samples). The intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) of urinary concentrations in samples from individual women ranged from 0.48 and 0.62 for all phenols except bisphenol A (ICC = 0.11).CONCLUSION: Amniotic fluid detection frequencies for most phenols were low. The reproducibility of urine measures was poor for bisphenol A, but good for the other phenols. Although a single sample may provide a reasonable estimate of exposure for some phenols, collecting multiple urine samples during pregnancy is an option to reduce exposure measurement error in studies regarding the effects of phenol prenatal exposure on health.Citation: Philippat C, Wolff MS, Calafat AM, Ye X, Bausell R, Meadows M, Stone J, Slama R, Engel SM. 2013.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although dietary supplements are commonly taken to prevent chronic disease, the long-term health consequences of many compounds are unknown. METHODS: We assessed the use of vitamin and mineral supplements in relation to total mortality in 38,772 older women in the Iowa Women's Health Study; mean age was 61.6 years at baseline in 1986. Supplement use was self-reported in 1986, 1997, and 2004. Through December 31, 2008, a total of 15 594 deaths (40.2%) were identified through the State Health Registry of Iowa and the National Death Index. RESULTS: In multivariable adjusted proportional hazards regression models, the use of multivitamins (hazard ratio, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.02-1.10; absolute risk increase, 2.4%), vitamin B(6) (1.10; 1.01-1.21; 4.1%), folic acid (1.15; 1.00-1.32; 5.9%), iron (1.10; 1.03-1.17; 3.9%), magnesium (1.08; 1.01-1.15; 3.6%), zinc (1.08; 1.01-1.15; 3.0%), and copper (1.45; 1.20-1.75; 18.0%) were associated with increased risk of total mortality when compared with corresponding nonuse. Use of calcium was inversely related (hazard ratio, 0.91; 95% confidence interval, 0.88-0.94; absolute risk reduction, 3.8%). Findings for iron and calcium were replicated in separate, shorter-term analyses (10-year, 6-year, and 4-year follow-up), each with approximately 15% of the original participants having died, starting in 1986, 1997, and 2004. CONCLUSIONS: In older women, several commonly used dietary vitamin and mineral supplements may be associated with increased total mortality risk; this association is strongest with supplemental iron. In contrast to the findings of many studies, calcium is associated with decreased risk.",

        "abstract": "Bleeding disorders may present during the neonatal period, however, absent patient history along with unique physical signs, physiologically decreased levels of plasma proteins and laboratory variations of platelet function tests may render any diagnosis difficult to establish. Intra cranial haemorrhage (ICH) may be the clinical presenting symptom of a severe coagulation factor deficiency. Haemophilia in the newborn period poses unique challenges in diagnosis and management, Data presented from the UDC and similar surveillance systems world-wide can be used to further clinical research and improve management strategies. Development haemostasis should be considered as well as laboratory variations of coagulation tests while evaluating and diagnosis neonates suspected of bleeding disorders. Therapy of bleeding episodes in the neonate relies upon proper replacement and repeated haemostatic evaluation of patients' status, while dealing with underlying etiological causes. This manuscript discusses the unique aspects of clinical presentation, laboratory assessment, and treatment of various bleeding disorders in neonates.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The Republic of Congo has had no cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) since 2000. In October 2010, a neurologist noted an abnormal number of cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) among adults which were later confirmed to be caused by WPV1. METHODS: Those presenting with AFP underwent clinical history, physical examination, and clinical specimen collection to determine if they had polio. AFP cases were classified as laboratory-confirmed, clinical, or non-polio AFP. Epidemiologic features of the outbreak were analyzed. RESULTS: From September 19, 2010 to January 22, 2011, 445 WPV1 cases were reported in the ROC; 390 cases were from Pointe Noire. Overall, 331 cases were among adults; 378 cases were clinically confirmed and 64 cases were laboratory confirmed. The case fatality ratio (CFR) was 43%. Epidemiologic characteristics differed among polio cases reported in Pointe Noire and cases reported in the rest of ROC, including age distribution and CFR. The outbreak stopped after multiple vaccination rounds with oral poliovirus vaccine which targeted the entire population. CONCLUSIONS: This outbreak underscores the need to maintain high vaccination coverage to prevent outbreaks, the need to maintain timely high quality surveillance to rapidly identify and respond to any potential cases before an outbreak escalates, and the need to perform ongoing risk assessments of immunity gaps in polio-free countries.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: As healthcare systems continue to expand and interconnect with each other through patient sharing, administrators, policy makers, infection control specialists, and other decision makers may have to take account of the entire healthcare 'ecosystem' in infection control. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a software tool, the Regional Healthcare Ecosystem Analyst (RHEA), that can accept user-inputted data to rapidly create a detailed agent-based simulation model (ABM) of the healthcare ecosystem (ie, all healthcare facilities, their adjoining community, and patient flow among the facilities) of any region to better understand the spread and control of infectious diseases. RESULTS: To demonstrate RHEA's capabilities, we fed extensive data from Orange County, California, USA, into RHEA to create an ABM of a healthcare ecosystem and simulate the spread and control of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Various experiments explored the effects of changing different parameters (eg, degree of transmission, length of stay, and bed capacity). DISCUSSION: Our model emphasizes how individual healthcare facilities are components of integrated and dynamic networks connected via patient movement and how occurrences in one healthcare facility may affect many other healthcare facilities. CONCLUSIONS: A decision maker can utilize RHEA to generate a detailed ABM of any healthcare system of interest, which in turn can serve as a virtual laboratory to test different policies and interventions.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: to examine the relationships between impairments in hearing and vision and mortality from all-causes and cardiovascular disease (CVD) among older people. DESIGN: population-based cohort study. Participants: the study population included 4,926 Icelandic individuals, aged >/=67 years, 43.4% male, who completed vision and hearing examinations between 2002 and 2006 in the Age, Gene/Environment Susceptibility-Reykjavik Study (AGES-RS) and were followed prospectively for mortality through 2009. METHODS: participants were classified as having 'moderate or greater' degree of impairment for vision only (VI), hearing only (HI), and both vision and hearing (dual sensory impairment, DSI). Cox proportional hazard regression, with age as the time scale, was used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) associated with impairment and mortality due to all-causes and specifically CVD after a median follow-up of 5.3 years. RESULTS: the prevalence of HI, VI and DSI were 25.4, 9.2 and 7.0%, respectively. After adjusting for age, significantly (P < 0.01) increased mortality from all causes, and CVD was observed for HI and DSI, especially among men. After further adjustment for established mortality risk factors, people with HI remained at higher risk for CVD mortality [HR: 1.70 (1.27-2.27)], whereas people with DSI remained at higher risk of all-cause mortality [HR: 1.43 (1.11-1.85)] and CVD mortality [HR: 1.78 (1.18-2.69)]. Mortality rates were significantly higher in men with HI and DSI and were elevated, although not significantly, among women with HI. CONCLUSIONS: older men with HI or DSI had a greater risk of dying from any cause and particularly cardiovascular causes within a median 5-year follow-up. Women with hearing impairment had a non-significantly elevated risk. Vision impairment alone was not associated with increased mortality.",

In contrast to the gt1 lyssavirus, rabies virus (RABV), LBV was reported to have markedly reduced levels of peripheral pathogenicity. However, this opinion was based on a study of one isolate of LBV only and the reduction in pathogenicity was essentially attributed to the amino-acid substitution at position 333 of glycoprotein ectodomain. In the present study we have demonstrated that peripheral pathogenicity of representatives of LBV in a murine model is as high as that of RABV. Comparison of amino-acid substitutions among the viral glycoproteins, demonstrated significant differences within two antigenic sites between different phylogenetic lineages of LBV. Such molecular variability potentially contributes to differences in peripheral pathogenicity of lyssaviruses.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In December 2010, a case of West Nile virus (WNV) encephalitis occurring in a kidney recipient shortly after organ transplantation was identified. METHODS: A public health investigation was initiated to determine the likely route of transmission, detect potential WNV infections among recipients from the same organ donor, and remove any potentially infected blood products or tissues. Available serum, cerebrospinal fluid, and urine samples from the organ donor and recipients were tested for WNV infection by nucleic acid testing and serology. RESULTS: Two additional recipients from the same organ donor were identified, their clinical and exposure histories were reviewed, and samples were obtained. WNV RNA was retrospectively detected in the organ donor's serum. After transplantation, the left kidney recipient had serologic and molecular evidence of WNV infection and the right kidney recipient had prolonged but clinically inapparent WNV viremia. The liver recipient showed no clinical signs of infection but had flavivirus IgG antibodies; however, insufficient samples were available to determine the timing of infection. No remaining infectious products or tissues were identified. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should suspect WNV as a cause of encephalitis in organ transplant recipients and report cases to public health departments for prompt investigation of the source of infection. Increased use of molecular testing and retaining pretransplantation sera may improve the ability to detect and diagnose transplant-associated WNV infection in organ transplant recipients.",

        "abstract": "This study compared HIV-1 genotypes shed over time (</= 3.5 years) in the vaginal secretions (VS) and blood plasma (BP) of 15 chronically infected women. Analysis of predicted coreceptor tropism (CCR5 = R5, CXCR4 = X4) for quasispecies shedding revealed three patterns: (1) viral quasispecies shed in both VS and BP were restricted to R5-tropism at all time points, (2) quasispecies shed in VS were restricted to R5-tropism at all time points but X4 quasispecies were identified in the BP at one or more time points, (3) quasispecies shed in matched VS and BP both contained X4-tropic viruses. Overall, the frequency of X4 quasispecies circulation in VS was 2-fold less than in BP and detection of X4 virus in VS was more likely to occur when X4 quasispecies comprised more than 50% of BP viruses (p = 0.01) and when declines in blood CD4+ lymphocyte levels were the greatest (p = 0.038). Additionally, the mean number of predicted N-glycosylation sites between matched VS and BP samples were strongly correlated (r = 0.86, p < 0.0001) with glycosylation densities in the following order (VS R5 = BP R5 > BP X4 > VS X4). The X4 glyscosylation densities may result from compartmentalization pressures in the female genital tract or the delayed appearance of these viruses in VS. Our results suggest that the presence of X4 virus in VS is associated with a threshold population of X4 quasispecies in BP which are increasing during the HIV-induced failure of the human immune system.",

        "abstract": "Upon delivery, the neonate is exposed for the first time to a wide array of microbes from a variety of sources, including maternal bacteria. Although prior studies have suggested that delivery mode shapes the microbiota's establishment and, subsequently, its role in child health, most researchers have focused on specific bacterial taxa or on a single body habitat, the gut. Thus, the initiation stage of human microbiome development remains obscure. The goal of the present study was to obtain a community-wide perspective on the influence of delivery mode and body habitat on the neonate's first microbiota. We used multiplexed 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing to characterize bacterial communities from mothers and their newborn babies, four born vaginally and six born via Cesarean section. Mothers’ skin, oral mucosa, and vagina were sampled 1 h before delivery, and neonates’ skin, oral mucosa, and nasopharyngeal aspirate were sampled <5 min, and meconium <24 h, after delivery. We found that in direct contrast to the highly differentiated communities of their mothers, neonates harbored bacterial communities that were undifferentiated across multiple body habitats, regardless of delivery mode. Our results also show that vaginally delivered infants acquired bacterial communities resembling their own mother's vaginal microbiota, dominated by Lactobacillus, Prevotella, or Sneathia spp., and C-section infants harbored bacterial communities similar to those found on the skin surface, dominated by Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium, and Propionibacterium spp. These findings establish an important baseline for studies tracking the human microbiome's successional development in different body habitats following different delivery modes, and their associated effects on infant health.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Persons with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and/or asthma have great risk for morbidity. There has been sparse state-specific surveillance data to estimate the impact of COPD or COPD with concomitant asthma (overlap syndrome) on health-related impairment. METHODS: The North Carolina (NC) Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) was used to assess relationships between COPD and asthma with health impairment indicators. Five categories [COPD, current asthma, former asthma, overlap syndrome, and neither] were defined for 24,073 respondents. Associations of these categories with health impairments (physical or mental disability, use of special equipment, mental or physical distress) and with co-morbidities (diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke, arthritis, and high blood pressure) were assessed. RESULTS: Fifteen percent of NC adults reported a COPD and/or asthma history. The overall age-adjusted prevalence of any self-reported COPD and current asthma were 5.6% and 7.6%, respectively; 2.4% reported both. In multivariable analyses, adults with overlap syndrome, current asthma only, and COPD only were twice as likely as those with neither disease to report health impairments (p < 0.05). Compared to those with neither disease, adults with overlap syndrome and COPD were more likely to have co-morbidities (p < 0.05). The prevalence of the five co-morbid conditions was highest in overlap syndrome; comparisons with the other groups were significant (p < 0.05) only for diabetes, stroke, and arthritis. CONCLUSIONS: The BRFSS demonstrates different levels of health impairment among persons with COPD, asthma, overlap syndrome, and those with neither disease. Persons reporting overlap syndrome had the most impairment and highest prevalence of co-morbidities.",

        "abstract": "The hand coordinate systems for measuring vibration exposures and biodynamic responses have been standardized, but they are not actually used in many studies. This contradicts the purpose of the standardization. The objectives of this study were to identify the major sources of this problem, and to help define or identify better coordinate systems for the standardization. This study systematically reviewed the principles and definition methods, and evaluated typical hand coordinate systems. This study confirms that, as accelerometers remain the major technology for vibration measurement, it is reasonable to standardize two types of coordinate systems: a tool-based basicentric (BC) system and an anatomically based biodynamic (BD) system. However, these coordinate systems are not well defined in the current standard. Definition of the standard BC system is confusing, and it can be interpreted differently; as a result, it has been inconsistently applied in various standards and studies. The standard hand BD system is defined using the orientation of the third metacarpal bone. It is neither convenient nor defined based on important biological or biodynamic features. This explains why it is rarely used in practice. To resolve these inconsistencies and deficiencies, we proposed a revised method for defining the realistic handle BC system and an alternative method for defining the hand BD system. A fingertip-based BD system for measuring the principal grip force is also proposed based on an important feature of the grip force confirmed in this study.",

METHODS: Prevalence rates from the 2010 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) were calculated for three workplace psychosocial factors (job insecurity, work-family imbalance, bullying/harassment) using SUDAAN to account for the complex NHIS sample design. RESULTS: Data were available for 17,524 adults who worked in the 12 months that preceded the interview. Overall prevalence rates were 31.7% for job insecurity, 16.3% for work-family imbalance, and 7.8% for hostile work environment (being bullied or harassed). The highest prevalence rate of job insecurity was found for construction and extraction occupations. Workers in legal occupations had the highest prevalence rate of work-family imbalance. Workers in protective service occupations had the highest prevalence rate of hostile work environment. CONCLUSIONS: We identified demographic characteristics along with industries and occupations with the highest prevalence rates for three adverse workplace psychosocial factors. These data can be used for benchmarking and identification of targets for investigation and intervention activities.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: We aimed to determine the frequency of pH1N1 transmission between humans and swine on backyard farms in Tumbes, Peru. DESIGN: Two-year serial cross-sectional study comprising four sampling periods: March 2009 (pre-pandemic), October 2009 (peak of the pandemic in Peru), April 2010 (1st post-pandemic period), and October 2011 (2nd post-pandemic period). SAMPLE: Backyard swine serum, tracheal swabs, and lung sample were collected during each sampling period. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We assessed current and past pH1N1 infection in swine through serological testing, virus culture, and RT-PCR and compared the results with human incidence data from a population-based active surveillance cohort study in Peru. RESULTS: Among 1303 swine sampled, the antibody prevalence to pH1N1 was 0% pre-pandemic, 8% at the peak of the human pandemic (October 2009), and 24% in April 2010 and 1% in October 2011 (post-pandemic sampling periods). Trends in swine seropositivity paralleled those seen in humans in Tumbes. The pH1N1 virus was isolated from three pigs during the peak of the pandemic. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that these viruses likely represent two separate human-to-swine transmission events in backyard farm settings. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that human-to-swine pH1N1 transmission occurred during the pandemic among backyard farms in Peru, emphasizing the importance of interspecies transmission in backyard pig populations. Continued surveillance for influenza viruses in backyard farms is warranted.",

        "abstract": "Recent advances in biotechnologies have led to speculations about enhancing human beings. Many of the moral arguments presented to defend human enhancement technologies have been limited to discussions of their risks and benefits. The author argues that in so far as ethical arguments focus primarily on risks and benefits of human enhancement technologies, these arguments will be insufficient to provide a robust defence of these technologies. This is so because the belief that an assessment of risks and benefits is a sufficient ethical evaluation of these technologies incorrectly presupposes that risk assessments do not involve value judgements. Second, it presupposes a reductionist conception of ethics as merely a risk management instrument. Each of these assumptions separates ethical evaluation from discussion and appraisal of ends and means and thus leaves important-indeed, essential-ethical considerations out of view. Once these problematic assumptions are rejected, it becomes clear that an adequate defence of human enhancement technologies requires more than a simple balance of their risks and benefits.",

METHODS: A quasi-experimental study design evaluated the effects of a highly adjustable chair with office ergonomics training intervention (CWT group) and the training only (TO group) compared with no intervention (CO group). Data collection occurred 2 and 1 month(s) pre-intervention and 2, 6 and 12 months post-intervention. During each data collection period, a work environment and health questionnaire (covariates) and daily health diary (outcomes) were completed. Multilevel statistical models tested hypotheses. RESULTS: Both the training only intervention (p<0.001) and the chair with training intervention (p=0.01) reduced visual symptoms after 12 months. CONCLUSION: The office ergonomics training alone and coupled with a highly adjustable chair reduced visual symptoms. In replicating results from a public sector worksite at a private sector worksite the external validity of the interventions is strengthened, thus broadening its generalizability.",

The relationship between blood lead and serum homocysteine concentrations was also investigated. In children 12 to 16 years old, no difference in the relationship between cognitive function and blood lead concentration between genotypes was found. In adults 20 to 59 years old, mean reaction time decreased as the blood lead concentration increased in the ALAD rs1800435 CC/CG group. This represents an improvement in performance. In adults 60 years and older, no difference in the relationship between cognitive function and blood lead concentration between genotypes was found. The serum homocysteine concentration increased as the blood lead concentration increased in adults 20 to 59 years old and 60 years and older, but there were no differences between genotypes. The mean blood lead concentration of children with the ALAD rs1800435 CC/CG genotype was less than that of children with the GG genotype.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention requirements for pre-immigration tuberculosis (TB) screening of children 2- to 14-years old permit a tuberculin skin test (TST) or an interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA). Few data are available on the performance of IGRAs versus TSTs in foreign-born children. METHODS: We compared the performance of TST and QuantiFERON-TB (QFT) Gold In-Tube in children 2- to 14-years old applying to immigrate to the United States from Mexico, the Philippines and Vietnam, using diagnosis of TB in immigrating family members as a measure of potential exposure. RESULTS: We enrolled 2520 children: 664 (26%) were TST+ and 142 (5.6%) were QFT+. One hundred and eleven (4.4%) were TST+/QFT+, 553 (21.9%) were TST+/QFT- and 31 (1.2%) were TST-/QFT+. Agreement between tests was poor (kappa = 0.20). Although positive results of both tests were significantly associated with older age (relative risks [RR] TST+, 1.64; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.36-1.97; RR QFT+, 3.05; 95% CI: 1.72-5.38) and with the presence of TB in at least 1 immigrating family member (RR TST+, 1.40; 95% CI: 1.12-1.75; RR QFT+ 2.24; 95% CI: 1.18-4.28), QFT+ results were more strongly associated with both predictive variables. CONCLUSIONS: The findings support the preferential use of QFT over TST for pre-immigration screening of foreign-born children 2 years of age and older and lend support to the preferential use of IGRAs in testing foreign-born children for latent TB infection.",

We interviewed fair attendees and conducted a retrospective cohort study among members of an agricultural club who attended the fair. Probable and confirmed cases of A(H3N2)v virus infection were defined by serology and genomic sequencing results, respectively. We identified 82 suspected, 4 probable, and 3 confirmed case-patients who attended the fair. Among 127 cohort study members, the risk for suspected case status increased as swine exposure increased from none (4%; referent) to visiting swine exhibits (8%; relative risk 2.1; 95% CI 0.2-53.4) to touching swine (16%; relative risk 4.4; 95% CI 0.8-116.3). Fairs may be venues for zoonotic transmission of viruses with epidemic potential; thus, health officials should investigate respiratory illness outbreaks associated with agricultural events.",

CDC recommends HIV testing at least annually for sexually active MSM to identify HIV infections and prevent ongoing transmission. Results of HIV testing conducted as part of the National HIV Behavioral Surveillance System (NHBS) in 21 cities indicated that 19% of MSM who were tested in 2008 were HIV-positive; of these, 44% were unaware that they were infected. To assess whether MSM were tested as recommended and whether more frequent testing might be indicated, CDC analyzed NHBS data for 2008. This report describes the results of that analysis, which indicated that, of 7,271 MSM interviewed and tested who did not report a previous positive HIV test, 61% had been tested for HIV infection during the past 12 months; among these, 7% had a new, positive HIV test result when tested as part of NHBS. Given the high prevalence of new HIV infection among MSM who had been tested during the past year, sexually active MSM might benefit from more frequent HIV testing (e.g., every 3 to 6 months).",

Baseline data from a larger study of homeless/unstably housed PLWHA indicated that 20% (125/644) intentionally abstained from sex in the past 90 days. Reasons included: (1) 'not interested' (n = 78); (2) did not want to infect someone (n = 46); and (3) did not have a partner (n = 37). Abstinence was less likely among all who had a main partner. Among men who have sex with men (MSM), abstinence was less likely among those with a detectable viral load. It was more likely among heterosexual men who were experiencing current housing problems and who had at least a high school education. Among women, abstinence was less likely among African Americans and those whose social networks were more aware of their HIV status. Better understanding of motivations to abstain may improve how programs serving PLWHA address this issue.",

        "abstract": "This report summarizes new recommendations and updates previous recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) for postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) to prevent human rabies (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Human rabies prevention--United States, 2008: recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2008;57:1-28). Previously, ACIP recommended a 5-dose rabies vaccination regimen with human diploid cell vaccine (HDCV) or purified chick embryo cell vaccine (PCECV). These new recommendations reduce the number of vaccine doses to 4. The reduction in doses recommended for PEP was based in part on evidence from rabies virus pathogenesis data, experimental animal work, clinical studies, and epidemiologic surveillance. These studies indicated that 4 vaccine doses in combination with rabies immunoglobulin (RIG) elicited adequate immune responses and that a fifth dose of vaccine did not contribute to more favorable outcomes. For persons previously unvaccinated with rabies vaccine, the reduced regimen of 4 1-mL doses of HDCV or PCECV should be administered intramuscularly. The first dose of the 4-dose course should be administered as soon as possible after exposure (day 0). Additional doses then should be administered on days 3, 7, and 14 after the first vaccination. ACIP recommendations for the use of RIG remain unchanged. For persons who previously received a complete vaccination series (pre-exposure prophylaxis or PEP) with a cell-culture vaccine or who previously had a documented adequate rabies virus-neutralizing antibody titer after vaccination with non-cell-culture vaccine, the recommendation for a 2-dose PEP vaccination series has not changed. Similarly, the number of doses recommended for persons with altered immunocompetence has not changed; for such persons, PEP should continue to comprise a 5-dose vaccination regimen with 1 dose of RIG. Recommendations for pre-exposure prophylaxis also remain unchanged, with 3 doses of vaccine administered on days 0, 7, and 21 or 28. Prompt rabies PEP combining wound care, infiltration of RIG into and around the wound, and multiple doses of rabies cell-culture vaccine continue to be highly effective in preventing human rabies.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Phthalates have been identified as endocrine active compounds associated with developmental and reproductive toxicity. The exposure to phthalates in premenstrual Egyptian females remains unknown. The objective of this study was to characterize phthalate exposure of a potentially vulnerable population of premenstrual girls from urban and rural Egypt. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We collected one spot urine sample from 60 10-13 year old females, 30 from rural Egypt, and 30 from urban Egypt from July to October 2009. Samples were analyzed for 11 phthalate metabolites. Additionally, we collected anthropometrics as well as questionnaire data concerning food storage behaviors, cooking practices, and cosmetic use. Phthalate metabolite concentrations were compared between urban and rural Egyptians as well as to age and gender matched Americans. RESULTS: Monoethyl phthalate (MEP), was detected at the highest concentration in urine of Egyptian girls (median: 43.2 ng/mL in rural, 98.8 ng/mL in urban). Concentrations of urinary metabolites of di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate and dibutyl phthalate were comparable between Egyptians and age matched US girls. Storage of food in plastic containers was a statistically significant predictor of urinary mono-isobutyl phthalate (MiBP) concentrations when comparing covariate adjusted means. CONCLUSIONS: Urinary concentrations of phthalate metabolites were similar in Egyptian and US populations, suggesting that phthalate exposure also occurs in developing nations. Dietary intake is likely an important route of exposure to phthalates in both urban and rural populations.",

        "abstract": "We propose guidelines to evaluate the cumulative evidence of gene-environment (G x E) interactions in the causation of human cancer. Our approach has its roots in the HuGENet and IARC Monographs evaluation processes for genetic and environmental risk factors, respectively, and can be applied to common chronic diseases other than cancer. We first review issues of definitions of G x E interactions, discovery and modelling methods for G x E interactions, and issues in systematic reviews of evidence for G x E interactions, since these form the foundation for appraising the credibility of evidence in this contentious field. We then propose guidelines that include four steps: (i) score the strength of the evidence for main effects of the (a) environmental exposure and (b) genetic variant; (ii) establish a prior score category and decide on the pattern of interaction to be expected; (iii) score the strength of the evidence for interaction between the environmental exposure and the genetic variant; and (iv) examine the overall plausibility of interaction by combining the prior score and the strength of the evidence and interpret results. We finally apply the scheme to the interaction between NAT2 polymorphism and tobacco smoking in determining bladder cancer risk.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Prevention of pre-invasive cervical lesions is an important benefit of HPV vaccines, but demonstrating impact on these lesions is impeded by changes in cervical cancer screening. Monitoring vaccine-types associated with lesions can help distinguish vaccine impact from screening effects. We examined trends in prevalence of HPV 16/18 types detected in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2, 3, and adenocarcinoma in situ (CIN2+) among women diagnosed with CIN2+ from 2008 to 2012 by vaccination status. We estimated vaccine effectiveness against HPV 16/18-attributable CIN2+ among women who received >/=1 dose by increasing time intervals between date of first vaccination and the screening test that led to detection of CIN2+ lesion. METHODS: Data are from a population-based sentinel surveillance system to monitor HPV vaccine impact on type-specific CIN2+ among adult female residents of five catchment areas in California, Connecticut, New York, Oregon, and Tennessee. Vaccination and cervical cancer screening information was retrieved. Archived diagnostic specimens were obtained from reporting laboratories for HPV DNA typing. RESULTS: From 2008 to 2012, prevalence of HPV 16/18 in CIN2+ lesions statistically significantly decreased from 53.6% to 28.4% among women who received at least one dose (Ptrend<.001) but not among unvaccinated women (57.1% vs 52.5%; Ptrend=.08) or women with unknown vaccination status (55.0% vs 50.5%; Ptrend=.71). Estimated vaccine effectiveness for prevention of HPV 16/18-attributable CIN2+ was 21% (95% CI: 1-37), 49% (95% CI: 28-64), and 72% (95% CI: 45-86) in women who initiated vaccination 25-36 months, 37-48 months, and >48 months prior to the screening test that led to CIN2+ diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Population-based data from the United States indicate significant reductions in CIN2+ lesions attributable to types targeted by the vaccines and increasing HPV vaccine effectiveness with increasing interval between first vaccination and earliest detection of cervical disease.",

        "abstract": "Fatalities in motor vehicle traffic crashes reached 43,510 in 2005. This was the highest number of fatalities reached since 1990. Since this recent peak, the number of reported fatalities has steadily declined every year, down to 37,261 in 2008. In particular, the number of fatalities reported for 2008, by NHTSA's Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS), decreased by almost 10 percent as compared to 2007. The 37,261 fatalities reported for 2008 also represented the lowest level of traffic fatalities since 1961. With fatalities projected to decline again in 2009 (down to 33,963), this would mean that between 2005 and 2009 motor vehicle traffic crash fatalities have declined almost 22 percent.: Also in 2008, the fatality rate per 100 million vehicle miles traveled (VMT) reached an all-time low of 1.25. The decline (down 2 percent) in the VMT was much less significant than the decline in the fatalities (down 10 percent). In addition to the sustained benefits from various vehicle and behavioral programs, the objective of this report is to identify areas that contributed to this significant decline in 2008. This report analyzes crash data from FARS and the National Automotive Sampling System General Estimates System (NASS GES), along with data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), to provide insight into the recent decline in fatalities. While the recorded number of fatalities is projected to significantly decline again in 2009 (down around 9%), the FARS data will not be available until the fall of 2010 for in-depth analysis. A significant decline from 2007 to 2008, slightly higher than 17 percent, was recorded for fatalities in crashes involving young drivers of passenger vehicles (ages 16-24). In comparison, fatalities in crashes involving passenger vehicle drivers between the ages of 25 to 44 decreased by about 11 percent, those between 45-64 years old decreased by about 10 percent, and those 65 years old and older decreased by about 7 percent. Child fatalities (under 16 years old) decreased by about 20 percent. Other areas of significant declines in fatalities were those that occurred in multiple-vehicle crashes (about 13%), crashes involving large trucks (about 12%), crashes that occurred during the weekend (about 11%) and for occupant fatalities in vehicles that rolled over in multiple-vehicle crashes (19%). Motorcyclist and pedalcyclist fatalities showed an increase in 2008. The long-term declining trend observed in fatalities since reaching a high in the early 1970s has occurred while significant vehicle and occupant safety regulations and programs were being enacted by NHTSA and the States. NHTSA-administered behavioral and vehicle safety programs, both in the crashworthiness and crash avoidance areas, and through the issuing of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards has contributed significantly to the long-term downward trend seen in motor vehicle traffic crash fatalities. Roadway improvements, as well as commercial vehicle programs have also contributed to the decline. In addition to the continued effect of these safety countermeasures, the large drop in fatalities in 2008 and 2009 has also coincided with a recession in the U.S. economy.",

METHODS: We examined the systolic blood pressure distributions across birth cohorts born between 1890 and 1990 in 68,070 participants, aged 18-74 years, in the National Health (and Nutrition) Examination Surveys between 1960 and 2008. We postulated that age-adjusted 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th percentiles of systolic blood pressure had decreased in more recent versus earlier cohorts, and that this pattern had slowed or reversed recently due, at least in part, to obesity. RESULTS: After adjusting for gender, race, age and age(2), the 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th percentiles of systolic blood pressure were 1.1, 1.4, 1.9, 2.5, and 3.4 mmHg lower for each decade more recently born (all P < .0001). Quadratic terms for birth cohort were positive and significant (P < .001) across all percentiles, consistent with a decelerating cohort effect. Mediation of this deceleration was observed for body mass index ranging from 20.4% to 44.3% (P < .01 at all percentiles). CONCLUSIONS: More recent cohorts born in the United States between 1890 and 1990 have had smaller increases in systolic blood pressure with aging. At any age, their systolic blood pressure distributions are shifted lower relative to earlier cohorts. Decreases of 1.9 mmHg in the median systolic blood pressure per decade translates into 11.4-13.3 mmHg over 6-7 decades, a shift that would contribute importantly to lower rates of cardiovascular diseases. These favorable changes are slowing, perhaps owing, at least in part, to the obesity epidemic.",

        "abstract": "Prenatal and perinatal exposures to air pollutants have been shown to adversely affect birth outcomes in offspring and may contribute to prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). For this ecologic study, we evaluated the association between ASD prevalence, at the census tract level, and proximity of tract centroids to the closest industrial facilities releasing arsenic, lead or mercury during the 1990s. We used 2000 to 2008 surveillance data from five sites of the Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) network and 2000 census data to estimate prevalence. Multi-level negative binomial regression models were used to test associations between ASD prevalence and proximity to industrial facilities in existence from 1991 to 1999 according to the US Environmental Protection Agency Toxics Release Inventory (USEPA-TRI). Data for 2489 census tracts showed that after adjustment for demographic and socio-economic area-based characteristics, ASD prevalence was higher in census tracts located in the closest 10th percentile compared of distance to those in the furthest 50th percentile (adjusted RR=1.27, 95% CI: (1.00, 1.61), P=0.049). The findings observed in this study are suggestive of the association between urban residential proximity to industrial facilities emitting air pollutants and higher ASD prevalence.",

T. b. macromelasoma displays greater variations in its chromatic phenotype than either T. b. brasiliensis or T. juazeirensis, and patterns reminiscent of one or the other. Experimental crosses from each of these members of the T. brasiliensis species complex generated fertile offspring suggesting that viable hybrids could be present in nature, despite their significant genetic distances. Considering the geographical position of occurrence of the T. b. macromelasoma (in Pernambuco) it was proposed to be an area capable of supporting natural hybridization between T. b. brasiliensis and T. juazeirensis. Since phenotypic variability is expected, this study investigated the existence of intermediate chromatic phenotypes for T. b. macromelasoma in various locations in areas between the T. b. brasiliensis and T. juazeirensis occurrences. Thirteen different color patterns were for the first time characterized and nine of those displayed intermediate phenotypes. Molecular analysis performed using ribosomal DNA intergenic region, grouped all within the T. brasiliensis complex. The intermediate chromatic phenotypes, molecular analysis and experimental crosses all support the distinction of a zone of hybridization that gave rise to the T. b. macromelasoma through homoploidal evolution.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The Ralph Lauren Cancer Center implemented patient navigation programs in sites across the United States building on the model pioneered by Harold P. Freeman, MD. Patient navigation targets medically underserved with the objective of reducing the time interval between an abnormal cancer finding, diagnostic resolution, and treatment initiation. In this study, the authors assessed the incremental cost effectiveness of adding patient navigation to standard cancer care in 3 community hospitals in the United States. METHODS: A decision-analytic model was used to assess the cost effectiveness of a colorectal and breast cancer patient navigation program over the period of 1 year compared with standard care. Data sources included published estimates in the literature and primary costs, aggregate patient demographics, and outcome data from 3 patient navigation programs. RESULTS: After 1 year, compared with standard care alone, it was estimated that offering patient navigation with standard care would allow an additional 78 of 959 individuals with an abnormal breast cancer screening and an additional 21 of 411 individuals with abnormal colonoscopies to reach timely diagnostic resolution. Without including medical treatment costs saved, the cost-effectiveness ratio ranged from $511 to $2080 per breast cancer diagnostic resolution achieved and from $1192 to $9708 per colorectal cancer diagnostic resolution achieved. CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicated that implementing breast or colorectal cancer patient navigation in community hospital settings in which low-income populations are served may be a cost-effective addition to standard cancer care in the United States.

Countries reporting outbreaks included Canada, Denmark, England and Wales, France, Germany, New Zealand, Norway, Serbia, and the United States. Together, these outbreaks resulted in 1946 reported human illnesses, 128 hospitalizations and two deaths. Infants/children were the primary population segments impacted by 36% (5/14) of spice-attributed outbreaks. Four outbreaks were associated with multiple organisms. Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica was identified as the causative agent in 71% (10/14) of outbreaks, accounting for 87% of reported illnesses. Bacillus spp. was identified as the causative agent in 29% (4/10) of outbreaks, accounting for 13% of illnesses. 71% (10/14) of outbreaks were associated with spices classified as fruits or seeds of the source plant. Consumption of ready-to-eat foods prepared with spices applied after the final food manufacturing pathogen reduction step accounted for 70% of illnesses. Pathogen growth in spiced food is suspected to have played a role in some outbreaks, but it was not likely a contributing factor in three of the larger Salmonella outbreaks, which involved low-moisture foods. Root causes of spice contamination included contributions from both early and late stages of the farm-to-table continuum.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Near real-time disease detection using electronic data sources is a public health priority. Detecting pneumonia is particularly important because it is the manifesting disease of several bioterrorism agents as well as a complication of influenza, including avian and novel H1N1 strains. Text radiology reports are available earlier than physician diagnoses and so could be integral to rapid detection of pneumonia. We performed a pilot study to determine which keywords present in text radiology reports are most highly associated with pneumonia diagnosis. DESIGN: Electronic radiology text reports from 11 hospitals from February 1, 2006 through December 31, 2007 were used. We created a computerized algorithm that searched for selected keywords (\"airspace disease\", \"consolidation\", \"density\", \"infiltrate\", \"opacity\", and \"pneumonia\"), differentiated between clinical history and radiographic findings, and accounted for negations and double negations; this algorithm was tested on a sample of 350 radiology reports. We used the algorithm to study 189,246 chest radiographs, searching for the keywords and determining their association with a final International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnosis of pneumonia. MEASUREMENTS: Performance of the search algorithm in finding keywords, and association of the keywords with a pneumonia diagnosis. RESULTS: In the sample of 350 radiographs, the search algorithm was highly successful in identifying the selected keywords (sensitivity 98.5%, specificity 100%). Analysis of the 189,246 radiographs showed that the keyword \"pneumonia\" was the strongest predictor of an ICD-9-CM diagnosis of pneumonia (adjusted odds ratio 11.8) while \"density\" was the weakest (adjusted odds ratio 1.5). In general, the most highly associated keyword present in the report, regardless of whether a less highly associated keyword was also present, was the best predictor of a diagnosis of pneumonia. CONCLUSION: Empirical methods may assist in finding radiology report keywords that are most highly predictive of a pneumonia diagnosis.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OVERVIEW: Changes in the science of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and transmission in a private dental practice provide an opportunity to update dental health care providers about this pathogen. The authors' aims in this review were to create awareness of health care- associated transmission of hepatitis C and provide an update on the changes in testing and treatment. The authors include data from population-based epidemiologic surveys, clinical practice guidelines, surveillance reports and practice protocols. RESULTS: In the United States, the elevated prevalence of chronic HCV infection among baby boomers-people born during the period from 1945 through 1965-led the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to release new national screening guidelines. The authors summarize information about the natural history and epidemiology of hepatitis C and describe the new guidelines and novel treatment options. In addition, the authors provide an overview of how outbreaks of health care-associated HCV are detected and prevented. Practical Implications. Because dental health care professionals likely will treat people with current infection, education in the current science of HCV infection is useful.",

Programmes described 516 unique partnerships with a median of seven organisations cited per STD programme. Non-profit organisations (including service providers) were most frequently cited. Higher gonorrhoea morbidity was associated with reporting more partnerships; budget problems were associated with reporting fewer.

        "abstract": "The clinical laboratory diagnosis of cutaneous anthrax is generally established by conventional microbiological methods, such as culture and directly straining smears of clinical specimens. However, these methods rely on recovery of viable Bacillus anthracis cells from swabs of cutaneous lesions and often yield negative results. This study developed a rapid protocol for detection of B. anthracis on clinical swabs. Three types of swabs, flocked-nylon, rayon, and polyester, were evaluated by 3 extraction methods, the swab extraction tube system (SETS), sonication, and vortex. Swabs were spiked with virulent B. anthracis cells, and the methods were compared for their efficiency over time by culture and real-time PCR. Viability testing indicated that the SETS yielded greater recovery of B. anthracis from 1-day-old swabs; however, reduced viability was consistent for the 3 extraction methods after 7 days and nonviability was consistent by 28 days. Real-time PCR analysis showed that the PCR amplification was not impacted by time for any swab extraction method and that the SETS method provided the lowest limit of detection. When evaluated using lesion swabs from cutaneous anthrax outbreaks, the SETS yielded culture-negative, PCR-positive results. This study demonstrated that swab extraction methods differ in their efficiency of recovery of viable B. anthracis cells. Furthermore, the results indicated that culture is not reliable for isolation of B. anthracis from swabs at >/=7 days. Thus, we recommend the use of the SETS method with subsequent testing by culture and real-time PCR for diagnosis of cutaneous anthrax from clinical swabs of cutaneous lesions.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Over half of U.S. HIV infections occur among men who have sex with men (MSM). Among MSM, 16% of estimated new infections in 2010 occurred among black MSM <25 years old. METHODOLOGY: We analyzed National HIV Behavioral Surveillance MSM data from 20 cities. Poisson models were used to test racial disparities by age in HIV prevalence, HIV awareness, and sex behaviors among MSM in 2014. Data from 2008, 2011, and 2014 were used to examine how racial/ethnic disparities changed across time. RESULTS: While black MSM did not report greater sexual risk than other MSM, they were most likely to be infected with HIV and least likely to know it. Among black MSM aged 18-24 years tested in 2014, 26% were HIV-positive. Among white MSM aged 18-24 years tested in 2014, 3% were HIV-positive. The disparity in HIV prevalence between black and white MSM increased from 2008 to 2014, especially among young MSM. CONCLUSIONS: Disparities in HIV prevalence between black and white MSM continue to increase. Black MSM may be infected with HIV at younger ages than other MSM and may benefit from prevention efforts that address the needs of younger men.",

Fewer re-infections occurred among patients who received EPT. Disproportionate rates of chlamydia occur among American Indian (AI) populations. To describe use of EPT among chlamydia cases diagnosed at an urban Indian Health Service (IHS) facility in Arizona, health records were used to extract confirmed cases of chlamydia diagnosed between January 2009 and August 2011. Medical records of 492 patients diagnosed with chlamydia were reviewed. Among the 472 cases who received treatment, 246 (52%) received EPT. Receipt of EPT was significantly associated with being female (odds ratio (OR) 2.1, 1.03-4.4, P < 0.001) and receipt of care in the women's clinic (OR 9.9, 95% CI 6.0-16.2) or in a primary care clinic (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.1-5.1). Compared with those receiving care in the women's clinic, the odds of receipt of EPT were significantly less in those attending the urgent/express care clinic (OR 0.1, 95% CI 0.06-0.2), and the emergency department (OR 0.1, 95% CI 0.05-0.2). Among treated patients who underwent re-testing (N = 323, 68% total treated) re-infection was less common among those that received EPT (13% versus 27%; OR 0.5, 95% CI 0.3-0.9). In this IHS facility, EPT was protective in preventing chlamydia re-infection. Opportunities to expand the use of EPT were identified in urgent and emergent care settings.",

We investigate associations between children's behavior, including hand-to-mouth contacts, and markers of PBDE exposure. In addition, we investigate associations between characteristics of the home environment and exposure. Eighty-three children aged 12-36 months were recruited from North Carolina (2009-2010). Children provided blood and handwipes samples, which were analyzed for PBDEs. Parents completed questionnaires, providing demographic, behavioral, and environmental data. More active children had higher levels of PBDEs on their hands and in their bodies. For example, children who spent more time sleeping had lower exposures to PBDEs; each additional hour of sleep resulted in a 30% decrease in handwipe BDE-99 levels (P<0.001) and a 15% decrease in serum (P=0.03). After accounting for handwipe PBDE levels, children who licked their fingers while eating had higher serum PBDEs. Other behaviors were not consistently associated with serum levels. Playing with plastic toys was associated with higher handwipe levels of PBDEs, while frequent vacuuming decreased handwipe PBDE levels. Characteristics of the home environment generally were not associated with serum PBDEs. Our results suggest that certain aspects of children's behavior and their environment impact exposure to PBDEs.",

        "abstract": "Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) can affect persons of any age, but it remains unknown whether children are more or less likely than adults to have MDR-TB. Representative drug resistance surveillance data reported to the World Health Organization between 1994 and 2011 were analysed to test the association between MDR-TB and age group (children aged <15 years versus adults aged >/= 15 years), using odds ratios derived by logistic regression with robust standard errors. Of 85 countries with data from nationwide surveys or surveillance systems, 35 reported at least one paediatric MDR-TB case. Aggregated data on age and drug susceptibility testing for 323 046 tuberculosis cases notified in these 35 countries were analysed. Odds ratios for MDR-TB in children compared to adults varied widely between countries. In Germany, Namibia, South Africa, the UK and the USA, MDR-TB was positively associated with age <15 years. In the remaining countries no association was established. Despite the limitations intrinsic to the use of surveillance data and to the challenges of diagnosing childhood tuberculosis, our analysis suggests that proportions of MDR-TB in children and adults are similar in many settings. Of particular concern is the association found between age <15 years and MDR-TB in southern African countries with high HIV prevalence.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: First pass methods based on BLAST match are commonly used as an initial step to separate the different phylogenetic histories of genes in microbial genomes, and target putative horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events. This will continue to be necessary given the rapid growth of genomic data and the technical difficulties in conducting large-scale explicit phylogenetic analyses. However, these methods often produce misleading results due to their inability to resolve indirect phylogenetic links and their vulnerability to stochastic events. RESULTS: A new computational method of rapid, exhaustive and genome-wide detection of HGT was developed, featuring the systematic analysis of BLAST hit distribution patterns in the context of a priori defined hierarchical evolutionary categories. Genes that fall beyond a series of statistically determined thresholds are identified as not adhering to the typical vertical history of the organisms in question, but instead having a putative horizontal origin. Tests on simulated genomic data suggest that this approach effectively targets atypically distributed genes that are highly likely to be HGT-derived, and exhibits robust performance compared to conventional BLAST-based approaches. This method was further tested on real genomic datasets, including Rickettsia genomes, and was compared to previous studies. Results show consistency with currently employed categories of HGT prediction methods. In-depth analysis of both simulated and real genomic data suggests that the method is notably insensitive to stochastic events such as gene loss, rate variation and database error, which are common challenges to the current methodology. An automated pipeline was created to implement this approach and was made publicly available at: https://github.com/DittmarLab/HGTector. The program is versatile, easily deployed, has a low requirement for computational resources. CONCLUSIONS: HGTector is an effective tool for initial or standalone large-scale discovery of candidate HGT-derived genes.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Expedited partner therapy (EPT) has been shown to reduce the risk of persistent or recurrent gonorrhea and chlamydial infection in heterosexuals, and to increase the proportion of sex partners receiving treatment. The objective of this analysis was to evaluate the consistency of EPT's effect across sociodemographic and behavioral subgroups. METHODS: Subset analyses from a randomized controlled trial compared EPT to standard partner referral (SPR) in sociodemographic and behaviorally defined subgroups. Outcomes included persistent or recurrent infection in study participants and participants' report that their partners received treatment. RESULTS: Reinfection risk was lower among EPT recipients than nonrecipients in 21 of 22 subgroups, with relative risks (RRs) varying from 0.4 to 0.94. Compared to persons receiving SPR, persons receiving EPT were more likely to report that their partners were very likely to have been treated in 33 of 34 subgroups (RRs range, 1.03-1.36). Although EPT reduced the risk of persistent or recurrent infection somewhat more in men (RR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.3-1.08) than in women (RR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.61-1.07) and more in persons with gonorrhea (RR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.13-0.78) than those with chlamydial infection (RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.63-1.07), the RR of partners being treated associated with EPT was similar in men (RR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.05-1.39) and women (RR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.10-1.27), and also in persons with gonorrhea (RR, 1.33; 95% CI, 0.80-2.23) and chlamydial infection (RR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.07-1.66). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, EPT is shown to be superior to SPR across a wide spectrum of sociodemographic and behaviorally defined subgroups.",

NCDPH requested HBV testing of all persons who had resided in the facility during January 1--October 13, 2010, and defined an outbreak-associated case as either 1) positive hepatitis B surface antigen and core immunoglobulin M (IgM) results or 2) clinical evidence of acute hepatitis (jaundice or serum aminotransferase levels twice the upper limit of normal) with onset >/=6 weeks after admission to the facility. Records were reviewed for potential health-care--associated exposures and HBV-related risk factors.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) result in more deaths globally than other causes. Monitoring systems require strengthening to attribute the NCD burden and deaths in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). Data from health and demographic surveillance systems (HDSS) can contribute towards this goal. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Between 2003 and 2010, 15,228 deaths in adults aged 15 years (y) and older were identified retrospectively using the HDSS census and verbal autopsy in rural western Kenya, attributed into broad categories using InterVA-4 computer algorithms; 37% were ascribed to NCDs, 60% to communicable diseases (CDs), 3% to injuries, and <1% maternal causes. Median age at death for NCDs was 66y and 71y for females and males, respectively, with 43% (39% male, 48% female) of NCD deaths occurring prematurely among adults aged below 65y. NCD deaths were mainly attributed to cancers (35%) and cardio-vascular diseases (CVDs; 29%). The proportionate mortality from NCDs rose from 35% in 2003 to 45% in 2010 (chi2 linear trend 93.4; p<0.001). While overall annual mortality rates (MRs) for NCDs fell, cancer-specific MRs rose from 200 to 262 per 100,000 population, mainly due to increasing deaths in adults aged 65y and older, and to respiratory neoplasms in all age groups. The substantial fall in CD MRs resulted in similar MRs for CDs and NCDs among all adult females by 2010. NCD MRs for adults aged 15y to <65y fell from 409 to 183 per 100,000 among females and from 517 to 283 per 100,000 population among males. NCD MRs were higher among males than females aged both below, and at or above, 65y. CONCLUSIONS: NCDs constitute a significant proportion of deaths in rural western Kenya. Evidence of the increasing contribution of NCDs to overall mortality supports international recommendations to introduce or enhance prevention, screening, diagnosis and treatment programmes in LMICs.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: As healthcare personnel (HCP) influenza vaccination becomes a quality indicator for healthcare facilities, effective interventions are needed. This study was designed to test a factorial design to improve HCP vaccination rates. DESIGN: A before-after trial with education, publicity, and free and easily accessible influenza vaccines used a factorial design to determine the effect of mobile vaccination carts and incentives on vaccination rates of HCP, who were divided into groups on the basis of their level of patient contact (ie, business and/or administrative role, indirect patient contact, and direct patient contact). SETTING: Eleven acute care facilities in a large health system. PARTICIPANTS: More than 26,000 nonphysician employees. RESULTS: Influenza vaccination rates increased significantly in most facilities and increased system-wide from 32.4% to 39.6% (P<.001). In the baseline year, business unit employee vaccination rates were significantly higher than among HCP with patient contact; rates did not differ significantly across groups in the intervention year. In logistic regression that accounted for demographic characteristics, intervention year, and other factors, the use of incentives and/or mobile carts that provided access to vaccine at the work unit significantly increased the likelihood of vaccination among HCP with direct and indirect patient contact, compared with control sites. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions to improve vaccination rates are differentially effective among HCP with varying levels of patient contact. Mobile carts appear to remove access barriers, whereas incentives may motivate HCP to be vaccinated. Education and publicity may be sufficient for workers in business or administrative positions. Interventions tailored by worker type are likely to be most successful for improving HCP vaccination rates.",

While salvage, rescue and clean-up operations are generally well considered, including reviews and exercises, the expertise, resources, networks and logistical planning required to achieve prompt and effective post-spill impact assessment and monitoring are not generally well established. The arrangement and co-ordination of post-incident monitoring and impact assessment need to consider sampling design, biological effects, chemical analysis and collection/interpretation of expert local knowledge. This paper discusses the risks, impacts and mitigation options associated with accidental spills and considers the importance of pre-considered impact assessment and monitoring programmes in the wider response cycle. The PREMIAM (Pollution Response in Emergencies: Marine Impact Assessment and Monitoring; www.premiam.org) project is considered as an example of an improved approach to the planning, co-ordination and conduct of post-incident monitoring.",

        "abstract": "Personal genome testing is offered via the internet directly to consumers. Most tests that are currently offered use data from genome-wide scans to predict risks for multiple common diseases and traits. The utility of these tests is limited, predominantly because they lack predictive ability and clear benefits for disease prevention that are specific for genetic risk groups. In the near future, personal genome tests will likely be based on whole genome sequencing, but will these technological advances increase the utility of personal genome testing? Whole genome sequencing theoretically provides information about the risks of both monogenic and complex diseases, but the practical utility remains to be demonstrated. The utility of testing depends on the predictive ability of the test, the likelihood of actionable test results, and the options available for the reduction of risks. For monogenic diseases, the likelihood of known mutations will be extremely low in the general population and it will be a challenge to recognize new causal variants among all rare variants that are found using sequencing. For complex diseases, the predictive ability of genetic tests will be mainly restricted by the heritability of the disease, but also by the genetic complexity of the disease etiology, which determines the extent to which the heritability can be understood. Given that numerous genetic and non-genetic risk factors interact in the causation of complex diseases, the predictive ability of genetic models will likely remain modest. Personal genome testing will have minimal benefits for individual consumers unless major breakthroughs are made in the near future.",

        "abstract": "Catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) is common, costly, and causes significant patient morbidity. CAUTIs are associated with hospital pathogens with a high propensity toward antimicrobial resistance. Treatment of asymptomatic patients with CAUTI accounts for excess antimicrobial use in hospitals and should be avoided. Duration of urinary catheterization is the predominant risk for CAUTI; preventive measures directed at limiting placement and early removal of urinary catheters have an impact on decreasing CAUTI rates. The use of bladder bundles and collaboratives, coupled with the support and active engagement from both hospital leaders and followers, seem to help prevent this common problem.",

Associations between SHS and CRS were evaluated by conditional logistic regression odds ratios. SETTING: Henry Ford Health System, Detroit, Michigan. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 306 nonsmoking patients diagnosed as having an incident case of CRS and 306 age-matched, sex-matched, and race/ethnicity-matched nonsmoking control patients. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Exposure to SHS for the 5 years before diagnosis of CRS (case patients) and before study entry (controls) for 4 primary sources: home, work, public places, and private social functions outside the home, such as parties, dinners, and weddings. RESULTS: Of controls and case patients, respectively, 28 (9.1%) and 41 (13.4%) had SHS exposure at home, 21 (6.9%) and 57 (18.6%) at work, 258 (84.3%) and 276 (90.2%) in public places, and 85 (27.8%) and 157 (51.3%) at private social functions. Adjusted for potential confounders (socioeconomic status and exposures to air pollution and chemicals or respiratory irritants from hobbies, work, or elsewhere), the odds ratios for CRS were 1.69 (95% confidence interval, 0.92-3.10) for SHS exposure at home, 2.81 (1.42-5.57) for exposure at work, 1.48 (0.88-2.49) for exposure in public places, and 2.60 (1.74-3.89) for exposure at private functions. A strong, independent dose-response relationship existed between CRS and the number of venues where SHS exposure occurred (odds ratio per 1 of 4 levels, 2.03; 95% confidence interval, 1.55-2.66). Approximately 40.0% of CRS appeared to be attributable to SHS. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to SHS is common and significantly independently associated with CRS. These findings have important clinical and public health implications.",

A radiant-panel apparatus was used to determine the materials' relevant thermal characteristics: time to ignition, critical heat flux for ignition, heat of gasification, and mass-loss rate. Three thermal parameters, TRP, TP1 and TP4, were derived from the data, then developed and subsequently used to rank the combined ignition and fire hazards of the combustible materials from low hazard to high hazard. The results compared favorably with the thermal and ignition hazards of similar materials reported in the literature and support this approach as a simpler one for quantifying these combustible hazards.",

METHODS: We developed the Carolina HPV Immunization Attitudes and Beliefs Scale (CHIAS), using data collected on 783 parents who had not yet vaccinated their daughters against HPV. We conducted a principal components analysis of 16 HPV vaccine attitude and belief items, assessed the scale's psychometric properties, and used linear regression to examine the relationship of CHIAS factors and parents' vaccination intentions. RESULTS: Analyses identified 4 CHIAS factors, all of which had acceptable scale alphas and 1-year test-retest reliability. In multivariate models, higher vaccination intentions were associated with: believing HPV vaccine is effective (beta = 0.06) or has less harmful effects (beta = -0.47), perceiving more barriers to access (beta = 0.18), and having less uncertainty about the vaccine (beta = -0.23) (all P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that parent attitudes about HPV vaccine are important to their intentions to vaccinate their adolescent daughters against HPV. The CHIAS offers researchers a compact, standardized measure of important HPV vaccine attitudes and beliefs.",

        "abstract": "Transferrin receptor 1 (Tfr1) facilitates cellular iron uptake through receptor-mediated endocytosis of iron-loaded transferrin. It is expressed in the intestinal epithelium but not involved in dietary iron absorption. To investigate its role, we inactivated the Tfr1 gene selectively in murine intestinal epithelial cells. The mutant mice had severe disruption of the epithelial barrier and early death. There was impaired proliferation of intestinal epithelial cell progenitors, aberrant lipid handling, increased mRNA expression of stem cell markers, and striking induction of many genes associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Administration of parenteral iron did not improve the phenotype. Surprisingly, however, enforced expression of a mutant allele of Tfr1 that is unable to serve as a receptor for iron-loaded transferrin appeared to fully rescue most animals. Our results implicate Tfr1 in homeostatic maintenance of the intestinal epithelium, acting through a role that is independent of its iron-uptake function.",

To support these explorations, the Office of Public Health Genomics at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provided cooperative agreement funds from 2003 through 2008. The 4 states' chronic disease programs identified advocates, formed partnerships, and assessed public data; they integrated genomics into existing state plans for genetics and chronic disease prevention; they developed projects focused on prevention of asthma, cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and other chronic conditions; and they created educational curricula and materials for health workers, policymakers, and the public. Each state's program was different because of the need to adapt to existing culture, infrastructure, and resources, yet all were able to enhance their chronic disease prevention programs with the use of family health history, a low-tech \"genomic tool.\" Additional states are drawing on the experience of these 4 states to develop their own approaches.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chlamydia screening practices, positivity, and trends from 2004 to 2009 in publicly funded prenatal clinics have not been described. METHODS: A phone-based survey assessing chlamydia screening practices was conducted among a random sample of clinics providing prenatal services (prenatal, family planning, and integrated clinics: \"prenatal clinics\") that reported data to the Infertility Prevention Project (IPP) in 2008. Using existing IPP data, chlamydia positivity and trends were assessed among women aged 15 to 24 years seeking care in any prenatal clinic reporting >/=3 years of data to IPP from 2004 to 2009. Linear trends of the effect of year (a continuous variable) on positivity were evaluated using a correlated modeling approach with a random intercept where the unit of analysis was the individual clinic performing chlamydia tests (clinic-based analysis). Covariates included race, age, test technology, and geography. RESULTS: Of 210 sampled clinics, 166 (79%) completed the survey. Of these, 163 (98.2%) had documented chlamydia screening criteria. Most clinics screened all women during their first trimester and reported 100% screening coverage. From 2004 to 2009, 267,416 tests among women aged 15 to 24 years were reported to IPP from eligible prenatal clinics. Overall chlamydia positivity was 8.3%. Controlling for all covariates, positivity decreased from 2004 to 2009 (odds ratio: 0.93 per year, 95% confidence interval: 0.92, 0.95, 35% decrease overall). CONCLUSIONS: The substantial burden of chlamydia among young women tested in prenatal clinics reporting data to IPP suggests the continued need for routine screening. Decreasing trends from 2004 to 2009 in the IPP prenatal population correspond to findings of overall decreasing chlamydia prevalence in the United States.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Falls are a leading cause of unintentional injury among adults age 65 years and older. Loose, unsecured rugs and damaged carpets with curled edges, are recognized environmental hazards that may contribute to falls. To characterize nonfatal, unintentional fall-related injuries associated with rugs and carpets in adults aged 65 years and older. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of surveillance data of injuries treated in hospital emergency departments (EDs) during 2001-2008. We used the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System-All Injury Program, which collects data from a nationally representative stratified probability sample of 66 U.S. hospital EDs. Sample weights were used to make national estimates. RESULTS: Annually, an estimated 37,991 adults age 65 years or older were treated in U.S. EDs for falls associated with carpets (54.2%) and rugs (45.8%). Most falls (72.8%) occurred at home. Women represented 80.2% of fall injuries. The most common location for fall injuries in the home was the bathroom (35.7%). Frequent fall injuries occurred at the transition between carpet/rug and non-carpet/rug, on wet carpets or rugs, and while hurrying to the bathroom. CONCLUSION: Fall injuries associated with rugs and carpets are common and may cause potentially severe injuries. Older adults, their caregivers, and emergency and primary care physicians should be aware of the significant risk for fall injuries and of environmental modifications that may reduce that risk.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Prevention providers wonder whether benefits achieved in the original, researcher-led, efficacy trials of interventions are replicated when the intervention is delivered in real-world settings by their agency's staff. METHODS: A replication study was conducted at 2 public sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics (New York City and San Juan, PR). Using a controlled trial design, intervention (VOICES/VOCES) and comparison conditions (regular clinic services) were assigned in alternating 4-week blocks. Trained agency staff delivered the intervention. Effectiveness was assessed for incident STDs, redemption of coupons for condoms at neighborhood location after the visit, and improved knowledge and attitudes about STDs and condoms.RESULTS: A total of 3365 patients were recruited, completed the protocol, and followed through STD surveillance systems for an average of 17 months. Of 397 with an incident infection, 226 (13.4%) were among those enrolled during comparison blocks; 171 were among those in the intervention condition (10.2%). Controlling for site and gender, participants enrolled during intervention blocks were significantly less likely to have an incident STD reported to the surveillance system (hazard ratio, 0.78; 95% confidence interval, 0.64-0.96). Intervention block participants scored higher on scales of STD knowledge (4.89 vs. 3.87, P < 0.001) and condom knowledge, attitude, and efficacy (10.98 vs. 9.16, P < 0.001). More of those exposed to VOICES/VOCES redeemed condoms (P < 0.05). Positive effects were more consistent in New York, which may be related to fidelity of implementation. CONCLUSIONS: A packaged human immunodeficiency virus prevention intervention can be delivered by agencies, with benefits similar to those achieved in the research setting.",

        "abstract": "We examined trends in low birth weight (LBW, <2,500 g) rates among US singleton non-Hispanic black infants between 1991 and 2004. We conducted Joinpoint regression analyses, using birth certificate data, to describe trends in LBW, moderately LBW (MLBW, 1,500-2,499 g), and very LBW (VLBW, <1,500 g) rates. We then conducted cross-sectional and binomial regression analyses to relate these trends to changes in maternal or obstetric factors. Non-Hispanic black LBW rates declined -7.35% between 1991 and 2001 and then increased +4.23% through 2004. The LBW trends were not uniform across birth weight subcategories. Among MLBW births, the 1991-2001 decease was -10.20%; the 2001-2004 increase was +5.61%. VLBW did not follow this pattern, increasing +3.84% between 1991 and 1999 and then remaining relatively stable through 2004. In adjusted models, the 1991-2001 MLBW rate decrease was associated with changes in first-trimester prenatal care, cigarette smoking, education levels, maternal foreign-born status, and pregnancy weight gain. The 2001-2004 MLBW rate increase was independent of changes in observed maternal demographic characteristics, prenatal care, and obstetric variables. Between 1991 and 2001, progress occurred in reducing MLBW rates among non-Hispanic black infants. This progress was not maintained between 2001 and 2004 nor did it occur for VLBW infants between 1991 and 2004. Observed population changes in maternal socio-demographic and health-related factors were associated with the 1991-2001 decrease, suggesting multiple risk factors need to be simultaneously addressed to reduce non-Hispanic black LBW rates.",

METHODS: Women aged 40 to 64 with mobility impairments who reported not receiving a mammogram in the last 2 years were randomly assigned to a PATHS workshop and received follow-up monthly phone call interviews over 6 months. RESULTS: Individual (eg, comorbidities, family responsibilities), interpersonal (eg, unclear provider communication, negative history), and environmental (eg, healthcare availability, insurance coverage, finances) factors were identified as unsolved barriers and potential facilitators (eg, reminders, physical proximity), to obtaining a mammogram.

        "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the US. Despite the decline in CVD-associated mortality rates in recent years, coronary heart disease (CHD) still causes one in every six deaths in this country. Because most CHD risk factors are modifiable (eg, smoking, hypertension, obesity, onset of type 2 diabetes, and dyslipidemia), cardiovascular risk can be reduced by timely and appropriate interventions, such as smoking cessation, diet and lifestyle changes, and lipid-modifying therapy. Dyslipidemia, manifested by elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), is central to the development and progression of atherosclerosis, which can be silent for decades before triggering a first major cardiovascular event. Consequently, dyslipidemia has become a primary target of intervention in strategies for the prevention of cardiovascular events. The guidelines of the Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III, updated in 2004, recommend therapeutic lifestyle changes and the use of lipid-lowering medications, such as statins, to achieve specific LDL-C goals based on a person's global cardiovascular risk. For high-risk individuals, such as patients with CHD and diabetic patients without CHD, an LDL-C target of < 100 mg/dL is recommended, and statin therapy should be considered to help patients achieve this goal. If correctly dosed in appropriate patients, currently approved statins are generally safe and provide significant cardiovascular benefits in diverse populations, including women, the elderly, and patients with diabetes. A recent primary prevention trial also showed that statins benefit individuals traditionally not considered at high risk of CHD, such as those with no hyperlipidemia but elevated C-reactive protein. Additional evidence suggests that statins may halt or slow atherosclerotic disease progression. Recent evidence confirms the pivotal role of statins in primary and secondary prevention.",

OBJECTIVE: To determine if the risk of serious cardiovascular harm is increased by rosiglitazone compared with pioglitazone, the other thiazolidinedione marketed in the United States. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Nationwide, observational, retrospective, inception cohort of 227,571 Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years or older (mean age, 74.4 years) who initiated treatment with rosiglitazone or pioglitazone through a Medicare Part D prescription drug plan from July 2006-June 2009 and who underwent follow-up for up to 3 years after thiazolidinedione initiation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Individual end points of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), stroke, heart failure, and all-cause mortality (death), and composite end point of AMI, stroke, heart failure, or death, assessed using incidence rates by thiazolidinedione, attributable risk, number needed to harm, Kaplan-Meier plots of time to event, and Cox proportional hazard ratios for time to event, adjusted for potential confounding factors, with pioglitazone as reference. RESULTS: A total of 8667 end points were observed during the study period. The adjusted hazard ratio for rosiglitazone compared with pioglitazone was 1.06 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.96-1.18) for AMI; 1.27 (95% CI, 1.12-1.45) for stroke; 1.25 (95% CI, 1.16-1.34) for heart failure; 1.14 (95% CI, 1.05-1.24) for death; and 1.18 (95% CI, 1.12-1.23) for the composite of AMI, stroke, heart failure, or death. The attributable risk for this composite end point was 1.68 (95% CI, 1.27-2.08) excess events per 100 person-years of treatment with rosiglitazone compared with pioglitazone. The corresponding number needed to harm was 60 (95% CI, 48-79) treated for 1 year. CONCLUSION: Compared with prescription of pioglitazone, prescription of rosiglitazone was associated with an increased risk of stroke, heart failure, and all-cause mortality and an increased risk of the composite of AMI, stroke, heart failure, or all-cause mortality in patients 65 years or older.",

        "abstract": "In an effort to contain the frequently devastating epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa, the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for Africa launched the Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) strategy in an effort to strengthen surveillance and response. However, 36 sub-Saharan African countries have been described as experiencing a human resource crisis by the WHO. Given this human resource situation, the challenge remains for these countries to achieve, among others, the health-related Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). This paper describes the process through which the African Field Epidemiology Network (AFENET) was developed, as well as how AFENET has contributed to addressing the public health workforce crisis, and the development of human resource capacity to implement: IDSR in Africa. AFENET was established between 2005 and 2006 as a network of Field Epidemiology Training Programs (FETPs) and Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Programs (FELTPs) in Africa. This resulted from an expressed need to develop a network that would advocate for the unique needs of African FETPs and FELTPs, provide service to its membership, and through which programs could develop joint projects to address the public health needs of their countries. A total of eight new programs have been developed in sub-Saharan Africa since 2006. Programs established after 2006 represent over 70% of current FETP and FELTP enrolment in Africa. In addition to growth in membership and programs, AFENET has recorded significant growth in external partnerships. Beginning with USAID, CDC and WHO in: 2004-2006, a total of at least 26 partners have been added by 2011. Drawing from lessons learnt, AFENET is now a resource that can be relied upon to expand public health capacity in Africa in an efficient and practical manner. National, regional and global health actors can leverage it to meet health-related targets at all levels. The AFENET story is one that continues to be driven by a clearly recognized need within Africa to develop a network that would serve public health systems development, looking beyond the founders, and using the existing capacity of the founders and partners to help other countries build capacity for IDSR and the International Health Regulations (IHR, 2005).",

        "abstract": "Nearly 20 million new sexually transmitted infections occur every year in the United States. Traditionally, men have demonstrated much greater risk for contraction of and mortality from STDs perhaps because they tend to engage in a number of risky sexual activities. Research on masculinity suggests that gender roles influence males' sexual health by encouraging risk-taking behavior, discouraging access to health services, and narrowly defining their roles as partners. However, despite the propensity of highly masculine men to engage in high-risk sexual behavior, there is reason to suspect that men at the other end of the continuum may still be driven to engage in similar high-risk behaviors as a consequence of gender socialization. Discrepancy stress is a form of gender role stress that occurs when men fail to live up to the ideal manhood derived from societal prescriptions (i.e., Gender Role Discrepancy). In the present study, we surveyed a national sample of 600 men via Amazon Mechanical Turk to assess perceived gender role discrepancy, experience of discrepancy stress, and the associations with risky sexual behavior and potential contraction of STDs. Results indicated that men who believe they are less masculine than the typical man (i.e., gender role discrepancy) and experience distress stemming from this discrepancy (i.e., discrepancy stress) engage in high-risk sexual behavior and are subsequently diagnosed with more STDs. Findings are discussed in relation to implications for primary prevention strategies.",

        "abstract": "Background. Echinocandins are first-line treatment for Candida glabrata candidemia. Echinocandin resistance is concerning due to limited remaining treatment options. We used data from a multisite, population-based surveillance program to describe the epidemiology and risk factors for echinocandin nonsusceptible (NS) C glabrata candidemia. Methods. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Emerging Infections Program conducts population-based laboratory surveillance for candidemia in 4 metropolitan areas (7.9 million persons; 80 hospitals). We identified C glabrata cases occurring during 2008-2014; medical records of cases were reviewed, and C glabrata isolates underwent broth microdilution antifungal susceptibility testing. We defined echinocandin-NS C glabrata (intermediate or resistant) based on 2012 Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute minimum inhibitory concentration breakpoints. Independent risk factors for NS C glabrata were determined by stepwise logistic regression. Results. Of 1385 C glabrata cases, 83 (6.0%) had NS isolates (19 intermediate and 64 resistant); the proportion of NS isolates rose from 4.2% in 2008 to 7.8% in 2014 (P < .001). The proportion of NS isolates at each hospital ranged from 0% to 25.8%; 3 large, academic hospitals accounted for almost half of all NS isolates. In multivariate analysis, prior echinocandin exposure (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 5.3; 95% CI, 2.6-1.2), previous candidemia episode (aOR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.2-5.1), hospitalization in the last 90 days (aOR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.0-3.5, and fluconazole resistance [aOR, 3.6; 95% CI, 2.0-6.4]) were significantly associated with NS C glabrata. Fifty-nine percent of NS C glabrata cases had no known prior echinocandin exposure. Conclusion. The proportion of NS C glabrata isolates rose significantly during 2008-2014, and NS C glabrata frequency differed across hospitals. In addition to acquired resistance resulting from prior drug exposure, occurrence of NS C glabrata without prior echinocandin exposure suggests possible transmission of resistant organisms.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Most studies of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) incidence and prevalence among workers have been limited by small sample sizes or restricted to a small subset of jobs. We established a common CTS case definition and then pooled CTS prevalence and incidence data across six prospective studies of musculoskeletal outcomes to measure CTS frequency and allow better studies of etiology. METHODS: Six research groups collected prospective data at >50 workplaces including symptoms characteristic of CTS and electrodiagnostic studies (EDS) of the median and ulnar nerves across the dominant wrist. While study designs and the timing of data collection varied across groups, we were able to create a common CTS case definition incorporating both symptoms and EDS results from data that were collected in all studies. RESULTS: At the time of enrollment, 7.8% of 4321 subjects met our case definition and were considered prevalent cases of CTS. During 8833 person-years of follow-up, an additional 204 subjects met the CTS case definition for an overall incidence rate of 2.3 CTS cases per 100 person-years. CONCLUSIONS: Both prevalent and incident CTS were common in data pooled across multiple studies and sites. The large number of incident cases in this prospective study provides adequate power for future exposure-response analyses to identify work and non-work related risk factors for CTS. The prospective nature allows determination of the temporal relations necessary for causal inference.",

        "abstract": "The distribution and evolution of human rotavirus strains is important for vaccine development and effectiveness. In settings where rotavirus vaccine coverage is high, vaccine pressure could select for replacement of common strains (similar to those included in rotavirus vaccines) with uncommon strains, some of which could be generated by reassortment between human and animal rotaviruses. Between 2002 and 2004, a phase-III rotavirus vaccine clinical trial was conducted among American Indian children of the Navajo and White Mountain Apache tribes, which are known to be at high risk for rotavirus diarrhea. We evaluated the rotavirus strains collected from study participants who received placebo during the trial to determine the distribution of rotavirus genotypes and to detect emerging strains that contribute to disease and could influence rotavirus vaccine effectiveness. Three uncommon strains of human rotavirus, two G3P[3] and one G3P[9] strains were detected in stools of children aged 3 to 6 months of age. Segments of all 11 rotavirus genes were sequenced and genotyped by comparison of cognate gene fragments with reference strains. The G3P[3] strains had similar genotypes to each other and to reference dog and cat strains. The G3P[9] strain had similar genotypes to cow, cat and dog reference strains. Genetic analyses of these three strains support the known diversity generating mechanisms of rotavirus. J. Med. Virol. 83:1288-1299, 2011. (c) 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: We asked whether visits to physician offices and hospital outpatient clinics for angina have changed over time and whether more frequent use of certain diagnostic techniques or referrals in this setting may account for such changes. METHODS AND RESULTS: We combined data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey to study visits to physician offices and outpatient departments. We calculated both crude and standardized rates for these visits using a modified version of technical specifications published by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. In 1995 to 1998, there were on average 3.6 million office/clinic visits each year for angina among adults in the United States. By 2007 to 2010, this had declined to 2.3 million visits each year. Angina visit rates per 100 000 declined significantly (P<0.05), with the greatest decline from 1995 through 1998 to 2003 through 2007. Coronary atherosclerotic disease diagnoses also declined after 2002. Both stress testing and referring patients out for care doubled during some study periods. CONCLUSIONS: Office and clinic visits for angina have declined over time. This trend parallels findings for both preventable hospitalization and emergency room visits for angina. Previous research’s decline in angina hospitalizations is not likely attributable to decreased referrals to hospital and emergency rooms for diagnosis and management. Although changes in International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification coding guidelines may explain some of the decline in angina and coronary atherosclerotic disease visits, it seems that other factors such as improved treatment or prevention may have played an additional role.",

        "abstract": "In 2001, letters filled with a powder containing anthrax (Bacillus anthracis) spores were delivered by mail to a number of governmental and media locations within the United States. In response, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provided guidelines for office personnel who might encounter a letter containing suspicious powder. These guidelines were developed during the crisis and in the absence of experimental data from laboratory or field investigations. An obvious need thus exists for quantitative and scientific verification for validation of these guidelines. This study attempts to address this need, adapting earlier work that used a multiple small office test site to create a model system in an open office test site in a vacated office building in which Bacillus atrophaeus spores (as a simulant for B. anthracis spores) were released by opening a letter. Using SF(6) as a tracer gas, smoke tubes (containing stannic chloride) to visualize airflow, culturable aerosol sampling, and aerosol spectrometry we were able to characterize airflow and unmitigated spore aerosol dissemination within the office test site. Subsequently, two scripted test scenarios were used to reproduce selected portions of the existing CDC response guidelines and a modified version where the contaminated letter opener warned co-workers to evacuate then waited 5 min before doing so himself. By not leaving together with other co-workers, the risk of the letter opener cross-contaminating others was eliminated. The total potential spore aerosol exposure of the letter opener was not affected by remaining still and waiting 5 min to allow co-workers to escape first before leaving the office. Closing office doors and quickly deactivating the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system significantly reduced spore aerosol concentrations outside the main open office in which they had been released.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To explore the impact of health professionals' recommendations for medical follow-up among colorectal cancer (CRC) survivors. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Mailed surveys and telephone interviews with CRC survivors in California. SAMPLE: 593 adults diagnosed with a primary CRC six to seven years before the time of the study. METHODS: Participants were identified through California Cancer Registry records and invited to take part in a survey delivered via mail or through telephone interview. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: The survey assessed cancer history, current preventive health practices, health status, demographics, and other cancer-related experiences. FINDINGS: More than 70% of CRC survivors received recommendations for routine checkups, surveillance colonoscopy, or other cancer screenings after completing CRC treatment, and 18%-22% received no such recommendations. Recommendations were sometimes given in writing. Receiving a recommendation for a specific type of follow-up was associated with greater adherence to corresponding guidelines for routine checkups, colonoscopy, mammography, and Papanicolaou testing. Receiving written (versus unwritten) recommendations led to greater adherence only for colonoscopy. CONCLUSIONS: Most CRC survivors reported receiving recommendations for long-term medical follow-up and largely adhered to guidelines for follow-up. Receiving a health professional's recommendation for follow-up was consistently associated with patient adherence, and limited evidence showed that recommendations in written form led to greater adherence than unwritten recommendations. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Given the increasingly important role of the oncology nurse in survivorship care, nurses can be instrumental in ensuring appropriate surveillance and follow-up care among CRC survivors. Conveying recommendations in written form, as is done in survivorship care plans, may be particularly effective. .",

        "abstract": "Norovirus outbreaks can be difficult to track due to the high frequency of environmental norovirus detection and the limited strain variation in some genotyping regions. However, rapid and accurate source identification can limit the spread of a foodborne outbreak and reduce the number of cases. Harmonization of genotyping assays is critical for enabling the rapid exchange of sequence data nationally and internationally. Several regions of the genome have been proposed for this purpose, but no consensus has been reached. In the present study, two standardized genotyping protocols (region C and region D) were evaluated by 9 laboratories in Canada and the United States using a coded panel of 96 fecal specimens representing 22 different norovirus genotypes. Overall, region C typing had a success rate of 78% compared to 52% for region D, however region D provides greater nucleotide sequence diversity for identifying new GII.4 variant strains. Significant differences in successful genotyping were observed between the 9 participating laboratories (10% to 100%) and between the different genotypes (6% to 100%). For several genogroup II strains, the reduced region D amplification correlated directly with mismatches between primer sequences and template. Based on overall performance, we recommended the region C protocol for routine genotyping of noroviruses while the region D protocol may be useful for identifying new GII.4 variants. Standardized genotyping will enable the rapid exchange of outbreak and sequence data through electronic norovirus surveillance networks.",

This article focuses on the commonalities and differences in the perceptions of CNAs and HHAs regarding the initial and continuing education they received to prepare them for their job. More than 80% of HHAs and all CNAs received some initial training. Of these, significantly more HHAs compared to CNAs felt that training had prepared them \"very well\" for their jobs. The two groups also differed in their assessments of the content of the initial training; for example, more CNAs believed that their training was \"excellent\" in helping them address patients' limitations in activities of daily living compared to HHAs. The vast majority of HHAs and CNAs received continuing education, and about three fourths in each group assessed this training as being \"very useful.\" In light of the increasing demands for HHAs and CNAs with the aging of America, findings from these national studies could be used to inform educational and training initiatives for this critical workforce.",

The objective of this study was to demonstrate the effectiveness of Hib conjugate vaccine against radiologically-confirmed hospitalized pneumonia in children. STUDY DESIGN: Children <2 years old with radiologically confirmed pneumonia admitted to 11 participating hospitals in Kiev and Dnepropetrovsk between April 2007 and June 2009 were included in a case-control evaluation. Four controls were matched to each case by date of birth (within 14 days) and outpatient clinic. We estimated ORs for vaccination and vaccine effectiveness ((1 - OR)*100%) using conditional logistic regression, adjusting for comorbid conditions and contraindications for vaccination. RESULTS: We enrolled 188 case-children and 735 controls. Median age was 16 months (range 4-24 months). Fifty-one percent of cases and 67% of controls received >/=1 doses of Hib conjugate vaccine; 26% of cases and 37% of controls received >/=3 doses. The effectiveness of >/=1 dose Hib conjugate vaccine was estimated at 45% (95% CI 18%-63%).

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To examine the patterns of change in cardiometabolic risk factors associated with the metabolic syndrome in children and adolescents between the ages of 8 to 19 years. STUDY DESIGN: Data of children and adolescents who participated in the Fels Longitudinal Study were analyzed. Body mass index, waist circumference, fasting insulin, fasting glucose, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure were assessed annually with a standardized protocol. RESULTS: The proportion of participants having at least 1 change between states of high and normal risk ranged from of 11.0% for body mass index to 30.4% for triglycerides. Youth in the high-risk category at baseline had a higher proportion having changed their status for all risk factors (all P < .05) except waist circumference compared with those in the normal-risk category. There were significant time effects for all risk factors (all P < .01) except fasting glucose and triglyceride levels in metric scores, but insignificant time effects for all risk factors in Z-scores in growth curve analyses. CONCLUSIONS: The cardiometabolic risk factors associated with the MetS were relatively stable among white children and adolescents in the normal risk category. Changes in status were common if the risk factor was elevated.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study investigated associations of violence-related behaviors with physical activity (PA)-related behaviors among U.S. high school students. METHODS: Data from the 2009 national Youth Risk Behavior Survey, a cross-sectional survey of a nationally representative sample of 9th-12th grade students, were analyzed. Sex-stratified, adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated for associations between violence-related behaviors and being physically active for >/=60 minutes daily, sports participation, TV watching for >/=3 hours/day, and video game/computer use for >/=3 hours/day. RESULTS: Among male students, at-school bullying victimization was negatively associated with daily PA (aOR: 0.72; 95%CI: 0.58-0.87) and sports participation; skipping school because of safety concerns was positively associated with video game/computer use (1.42; 1.01-2.00); and physical fighting was positively associated with daily PA. Among female students, at-school bullying victimization and skipping school because of safety concerns were both positively associated with video game/computer use (1.46; 1.19-1.79 and 1.60; 1.09-2.34, respectively), and physical fighting at school was negatively associated with sports participation and positively associated with TV watching. CONCLUSIONS: Bullying victimization emerged as a potentially important risk factor for insufficient PA. Schools should consider the role of violence in initiatives designed to promote PA.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Whether the enteric absorption of the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir is impaired in critically ill patients is unknown. We documented the pharmacokinetic profile of oseltamivir in patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) with suspected or confirmed pandemic (H1N1) influenza. METHODS: We included 41 patients 18 years of age and older with suspected or confirmed pandemic (H1N1) influenza who were admitted for ventilatory support to nine ICUs in three cities in Canada and Spain. Using tandem mass spectrometry, we assessed plasma levels of oseltamivir free base and its active metabolite carboxylate at baseline (before gastric administration of the drug) and at 2, 4, 6, 9 and 12 hours after the fourth or later dose. RESULTS: Among the 36 patients who did not require dialysis, the median concentration of oseltamivir free base was 10.4 (interquartile range [IQR] 4.8-14.9) microg/L; the median concentration of the carboxylate metabolite was 404 (IQR 257-900) microg/L. The volume of distribution of the carboxylate metabolite did not increase with increasing body weight (R(2) = 0.00, p = 0.87). The rate of elimination of oseltamivir carboxylate was modestly correlated with estimations of creatinine clearance (R(2) = 0.27, p < 0.001). Drug clearance in the five patients who required continuous renal replacement therapy was about one-sixth that in the 36 patients with relatively normal renal function. INTERPRETATION: Oseltamivir was well absorbed enterically in critically ill patients admitted to the ICU with suspected or confirmed pandemic (H1N1) influenza. The dosage of 75 mg twice daily achieved plasma levels that were comparable to those in ambulatory patients and were far in excess of concentrations required to maximally inhibit neuramini dase activity of the virus. Adjustment of the dosage in patients with renal dysfunction requiring continuous renal replacement therapy is appropriate; adjustment for obesity does not appear to be necessary.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Previous U.S. population modeling studies have reported that urinary cadmium (Cd) excretion patterns differ with age, sex, and dietary exposure; associations between Cd exposures and health outcomes also have differed by age and sex. Therefore, it is important to test models used to estimate Cd exposures across an expanded Cd-exposure range. OBJECTIVES: We estimated relative Cd exposures from both diet and smoking in low- and high-exposure scenarios to provide data for improving risk assessment calculations.Methods: We used a Cd toxicokinetic-based model to estimate Cd exposures based on urinary Cd levels measured for 399 persons in a low-exposure area (Bangkok) and 6,747 persons in a high-exposure area (Mae Sot) in Thailand. RESULTS: In Bangkok, we estimated dietary Cd exposures of 50-56 microg/day for males and 21-27 microg/day for females 20-59 years of age who never smoked. In Mae Sot, we estimated dietary Cd exposures of 188-224 microg/day for males and 99-113 microg/day for females 20-59 years of age who never smoked. In Bangkok, we estimated Cd exposures from smoking to be 5.5-20.4 microg/day for male smokers 20-59 years of age. In Mae Sot, we estimated Cd exposures from smoking to be 9.8-26 microg/day for male heavy smokers and 26 microg/day for female heavy smokers. CONCLUSION: This study provides estimates of Cd exposures from diet and smoking in low- and high-exposure scenarios. Our findings suggest a relatively small safety margin between the established tolerable Cd reference exposure of 62 microg/day and exposure levels previously associated with evidence of kidney and bone effects in Mae Sot residents, where dietary Cd exposures among women were only 1.6-2.1 times the reference value.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Epidemiologic studies remain inconclusive on whether the injectable contraceptive depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) increases mucosal HIV shedding and transmissibility. Nonhuman primate models may help to determine the effects of DMPA on acute HIV replication. DESIGN: We defined a physiologic dose of DMPA in macaques and assessed the impact of DMPA on acute simian HIV (SHIV) replication. METHODS: Pigtail macaques received 1-30 mg of DMPA intramuscularly followed by measurements of progesterone and medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA). Vaginal epithelial thickness, number of cell layers and density of intraepithelial CD3 cells were measured. The effect of DMPA on SHIV viremia and genital virus shedding was investigated in six pigtail macaques infected during monthly treatment cycles with 3 mg DMPA. Six DMPA-untreated macaques were controls. RESULTS: Plasma MPA concentrations directly correlated with changes in epithelial thickness (correlation = 0.84; P < 0.001) and density of intraepithelial CD3 cells (correlation = 0.41; P = 0.02). A 3 mg DMPA dose recapitulated plasma MPA concentrations and changes in vaginal epithelial thickness seen in women. DMPA-treated and untreated macaques showed similar peak plasma viremia and RNA area under the curve0-12wk values (P = 0.94), although treated macaques had higher odds of having virus being detected in plasma (odds ratio 6.6, P = 0.02). Rectal and vaginal virus shedding was similar between treated and untreated macaques (P = 0.72 and P = 0.53, respectively). CONCLUSION: In this pigtail macaque model of DMPA and vaginal SHIV infection, we found little or no effect of DMPA on plasma viremia and mucosal virus shedding during acute infection. These results do not support a role of DMPA in increasing mucosal virus shedding.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening is recommended for adults aged 50-75 years, yet screening rates are low, especially among the uninsured. The CDC initiated the Colorectal Cancer Control Program (CRCCP) in 2009 with the goal of increasing CRC screening rates to 80% by 2014. A total of 29 grantees (states and tribal organizations) receive CRCCP funding to (1) screen uninsured adults and (2) promote CRC screening at the population level. PURPOSE: CRCCP encourages grantees to use one or more of five evidence-based interventions (EBIs) recommended by the Guide to Community Preventive Services. The purpose of the study was to evaluate grantees' EBI use. METHODS: A web-based survey was conducted in 2011 measuring grantees' use of CRC screening EBIs and identifying their implementation partners. Data were analyzed in 2012. RESULTS: Twenty-eight grantees (97%) completed the survey. Most respondents (96%) used small media. Fewer used client reminders (75%); reduction of structural barriers (50%); provider reminders (32%); or provider assessment and feedback (50%). Provider-oriented EBIs were rated as harder to implement than client-oriented EBIs. Grantees partnered with several types of organizations to implement EBIs, many with county- or state-wide reach. CONCLUSIONS: Almost all grantees implement EBIs to promote CRC screening, but the EBIs that may have the greatest impact with CRC screening are implemented by fewer grantees in the first 2 years of the CRCCP.",

        "abstract": "Concept mapping is a tool to assist in strategic planning that allows planners to work through a sequence of phases to produce a conceptual framework. Although several studies describe how concept mapping is applied to various public health problems, the flexibility of the methods used in each phase of the process is often overlooked. If practitioners were more aware of the flexibility, more public health endeavors could benefit from using concept mapping as a tool for strategic planning. The objective of this article is to describe how the 6 concept-mapping phases originally outlined by William Trochim guided our strategic planning process and how we adjusted the specific methods in the first 2 phases to meet the specialized needs and requirements to create The Healthy Brain Initiative: A National Public Health Road Map to Maintaining Cognitive Health. In the first stage (phases 1 and 2 of concept mapping), we formed a steering committee, convened 4 work groups over a period of 3 months, and generated an initial set of 42 action items grounded in science. In the second stage (phases 3 and 4), we engaged stakeholders in sorting and rating the action items and constructed a series of concept maps. In the third and final stage (phases 5 and 6), we examined and refined the action items and generated a final concept map consisting of 44 action items. We then selected the top 10 action items, and in 2007, we published The Healthy Brain Initiative: A National Public Health Road Map to Maintaining Cognitive Health, which represents the strategic plan for The Healthy Brain Initiative.",

        "abstract": "The 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) was introduced into the routine immunization program in Uruguay in March 2008 with a 2-dose primary series (given at 2 and 4 months) plus a booster (at 12 months) and a catch-up campaign (two doses given at 15 and 17 months). We used a case-control methodology and existing laboratory surveillance and immunization registry data from Uruguay to evaluate PCV7 effectiveness against vaccine-type invasive pneumococcal disease (VT-IPD). Cases of VT-IPD (with pneumococcus obtained from a normally sterile site) were identified through the National Reference Laboratory. Age- and neighborhood-matched controls were obtained through a national immunization registry in which all children are enrolled at birth regardless of vaccine receipt; all eligible controls were included. Immunization status of cases and controls was assessed through the immunization registry, and conditional logistic regression was used to calculate PCV7 effectiveness. Between April 2008 and February 2010, 44 cases of VT-IPD among children<5 years were identified; 43 (98%) of those children were located in the registry. Among located case patients, 7 (16.3%) were age-eligible to have received at least one dose of PCV7. A total of 637 matched controls were included. Vaccine effectiveness was 91.3% (95% CI: 46.4, 98.6) for >/=1 PCV7 doses and 94.8% (95% CI: 43.1, 99.5) for >/=2 PCV7 doses. Using existing data we demonstrated high effectiveness of PCV7 against VT-IPD in Uruguay-a middle-income country using a 2-dose primary series plus a booster dose and a limited catch-up campaign. These data also highlight the utility of surveillance and high-quality immunization registries for evaluating the effectiveness of vaccines.",

        "abstract": "Lead poisoning in children is a preventable public health problem that can adversely affect the developing nervous system and result in learning and behavior problems. The most common source of exposure for lead-poisoned children aged <6 years in the United States is lead-based paint. However, nonpaint sources have been identified increasingly as the cause of lead poisoning, particularly in immigrant communities. This report describes a case of lead poisoning in a child aged 1 year that was investigated by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene's (NYC DOHMH) Lead Poisoning Prevention Program in 2009. The likely source of exposure was an amulet made in Cambodia with leaded beads that was worn by the child. Health-care providers and public health workers should consider traditional customs when seeking sources of lead exposure in Southeast Asian populations. Health-care providers should ask parents about their use of amulets, especially those in Southeast Asian families and those with children found to have elevated blood lead levels (BLLs). Educational efforts are needed to inform Southeast Asian immigrants that amulets can be a source of lead poisoning.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Health risks of using styrene to manufacture windblades for the green energy sector are unknown. METHODS: Using data collected from 355 (73%) current windblade workers and regression analysis, we investigated associations between health outcomes and styrene exposure estimates derived from urinary styrene metabolites. RESULTS: The median current styrene exposure was 53.6 mg/g creatinine (interquartile range: 19.5-94.4). Color blindness in men and women (standardized morbidity ratios 2.3 and 16.6, respectively) was not associated with exposure estimates, but was the type previously reported with styrene. Visual contrast sensitivity decreased and chest tightness increased (odds ratio 2.9) with increasing current exposure. Decreases in spirometric parameters and FeNO, and increases in the odds of wheeze and asthma-like symptoms (odds ratios 1.3 and 1.2, respectively) occurred with increasing cumulative exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Despite styrene exposures below the recommended 400 mg/g creatinine, visual and respiratory effects indicate the need for additional preventative measures in this industry.",

        "abstract": "With improved survival and new therapies for people with cystic fibrosis (CF), updated information on medical care expenditures for those individuals is needed. We estimated medical care expenditures, including both insurance reimbursements and patient out-of-pocket expenses, for privately insured people with CF and investigated how those expenditures varied with certain complications of CF. From a private insurance claims database of people covered by health plans associated with large corporate employers, we identified people with CF who were currently receiving medical care for the disorder and characterized their medical expenditures during the period 2004-2006. We selected a matching group of people who did not have CF based on age, sex, and geographic area, and calculated incremental expenditures associated with CF. We also examined the effect of age and certain complications of CF on these expenditures. The annual medical care expenditure for a person with actively managed CF averaged $48,098 in 2006 dollars, which was 22 times higher than for a person without CF. This ratio is high relative to other chronic disorders. Outpatient prescription medications made up the largest component of total expenditures for people with CF (39%). Those who were recorded in claims data as having a liver or lung transplant, malnutrition, diabetes, or a chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa pulmonary infection incurred much higher expenditures than people without these conditions. People with CF will incur high medical expenditures throughout their lifespan. These findings will assist in the development of economic evaluations of future CF screening and management initiatives.

METHODS: From 2005 to 2009, 6373 underground coal miners completed a health survey, including spirometry testing and chest radiography. Coal workers' pneumoconiosis and progressive massive fibrosis were determined by NIOSH B readers, using the International Labour Office classification. Prevalences of CWP and spirometry less than lower normal limits were mapped by county, and their association assessed. RESULTS: The prevalences of abnormal spirometry results and CWP were 13.1% and 4.0%, respectively. Counties with elevated prevalences for both the outcomes were located in contiguous areas of southeastern Kentucky, western Virginia, southern West Virginia, and eastern Pennsylvania. Prevalence of abnormal spirometry results increases with increasing category of simple CWP and progressive massive fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal spirometry in coal miners is associated with CWP; these two health outcomes have similar geographic distributions.",

DESIGN: Systematic, multi-city, community-based, cross-sectional assessment. METHODS: Time-location sampling was used to identify eligible youth ages 15-24 after city-wide mapping of 91 sites where street-involved youth gathered in Odessa, Kiev, and Donetsk. Universal sampling identified 961 youth in 74 randomly selected sites; 97% consented. Youth reporting 1 or both parents dead were classified as orphaned; those without a stable residence or sleeping outside their residence >/=2 nights/wk were classified as homeless. Trained staff provided HIV counseling and rapid testing via mobile vans. Adjusted odds ratios (AORs) were calculated using logistic regression, accounting for intra-cluster homogeneity. RESULTS: We found 32%(300/929) were both orphaned and homeless; 48% either homeless/not orphaned(37%[343/929]) or orphaned/not homeless(11%[104/929]); and 20%(182/929) neither orphaned nor homeless. HIV seroprevalences were 7% for neither orphaned/homeless; 16% and 17%, respectively, for either orphaned/homeless; 28% for both orphaned/homeless (p for trend<.0001). Adjusted odds ratios for HIV infection were 1.0 for neither; 2.3 and 2.4 for either homeless(95% confidence interval (CI) 1.7-2.9) or orphaned(CI 1.8-3.3); 3.3 for both orphaned/homeless(CI 2.3-4.4). Ever-use of injection drugs increased from 15% to 32% to 48% for those who neither, either, or both orphaned and homeless, respectively (p for trend <.0001). CONCLUSIONS: One of four youth who were both homeless and orphaned was HIV-infected; these youth were significantly more likely to be HIV-infected and to report injection drug use than those with adequate housing and living parents.",

Antibodies directed against the flavivirus nonstructural protein-1 (NS1) have been proposed as serological markers of natural infections among vaccinated populations. The aim of the current study is to optimize an IgM and IgG antibody-capture ELISAs (MAC/GAC-ELISA) to detect anti-NS1 antibodies and compare it with anti-E MAC/GAC-ELISA. Plasmids to express premembrane/envelope (prM/E) or NS1 proteins of six medically important flaviviruses, including dengue (DENV-1 to DENV-4), West Nile (WNV) and Japanese encephalitis (JEV) viruses, were constructed. These plasmids were used for the productions of prM/E containing virus-like particles (VLPs) and secreted NS1 (sNS1) from COS-1 cells. Archived clinical specimens from patients with confirmed DENV, JEV, WNV infections, along with naive sera, were subjected to NS1-MAC/GAC-ELISAs before or after depletion of anti-prM/E antibodies by pre-absorption with or without VLPs. Human serum specimens from previously confirmed DENV infections showed significantly enhanced P/N ratios for NS1-MAC/GAC-ELISAs after the depletion of anti-prM/E antibodies. No statistical differences in sensitivities and specificities were found between the newly developed NS1- and VLP-MAC/GAC-ELISAs. Further application of the assays to WNV and JEV infected serum panels showed similar results. A novel approach to perform MAC/GAC-ELISAs for NS1 antibody detection was successfully developed with great potential to differentiate antibodies elicited by the tetravalent chimeric yellow fever-17D/dengue vaccine or DENV infection.",

In the present work, bacterial DNA sequences related to Rickettsia amblyommii genes in A. dubitatum ticks, collected in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso, were discovered. Simultaneously, Paracoccus sp. was detected in aproximately 77% of A. cajennense specimens collected in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. This is the first report of Paracoccus sp. infection in a specific tick population, and raises the possibility of these bacteria being maintained and/or transmitted by ticks. Whether Paracoccus sp. represents another group of pathogenic Rhodobacteraceae or simply plays a role in A. cajennense physiology, is unknown. The data also demonstrate that the rickettsial 16S rRNA specific primers used for Rickettsia spp. screening can also detect Paracoccus alpha-proteobacteria infection in biological samples. Hence, a PCR-RFLP strategy is presented to distinguish between these two groups of bacteria.",

The aims of this analysis are to describe sun-safety behaviors and environmental supports depicted in the photos and to gain insight into pool staff perceptions of the program. A directed approach was used to assess the content of 1,886 photos submitted in 2005 and 2006. Staying in the shade and applying sunscreen were the most common sun-safety behaviors shown among children. Among adults and lifeguards, wearing sunglasses and a shirt with sleeves were most common. Most photos contained at least one sun-safety support, and half showed use of Pool Cool program materials. Most photos promoted the use of Pool Cool materials, sun-safety behaviors, or sun-safe pool environments. Participatory photojournalism is a low-cost and effective way to generate widespread interest and support for community health promotion programs.",

        "abstract": "In sub-Saharan Africa, HIV-1 infection frequently occurs in the context of other coinfecting pathogens, most importantly, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and malaria parasites. The consequences are often devastating, resulting in enhanced morbidity and mortality. Due to the large number of confounding factors influencing pathogenesis in coinfected people, we sought to develop a nonhuman primate model of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-malaria coinfection. In sub-Saharan Africa, Plasmodium falciparum is the most common malaria parasite and is responsible for most malaria-induced deaths. The simian malaria parasite Plasmodium fragile can induce clinical symptoms, including cerebral malaria in rhesus macaques, that resemble those of P. falciparum infection in humans. Thus, based on the well-characterized rhesus macaque model of SIV infection, this study reports the development of a novel rhesus macaque SIV-P. fragile coinfection model to study human HIV-P. falciparum coinfection. Using this model, we show that coinfection is associated with an increased, although transient, risk of both HIV and malaria transmission. Specifically, SIV-P. fragile coinfected macaques experienced an increase in SIV viremia that was temporarily associated with an increase in potential SIV target cells and systemic immune activation during acute parasitemia. Conversely, primary parasitemia in SIV-P. fragile coinfected animals resulted in higher gametocytemia that subsequently translated into higher oocyst development in mosquitoes. To our knowledge, this is the first animal model able to recapitulate the increased transmission risk of both HIV and malaria in coinfected humans. Therefore, this model could serve as an essential tool to elucidate distinct immunological, virological, and/or parasitological parameters underlying disease exacerbation in HIV-malaria coinfected people.",

        "abstract": "One of the many ethical challenges presented by research in genomics is that, although informed consent to research has traditionally been a matter for the individual participant, genomics research carries potential implications for genetic relatives. There are specific issues that arise when research is focused around populations or around family groups; this paper deals with the place of relatives of participants in genomics research more generally. Recently, in response to this challenge, recommendations have attempted to tread a middle ground by retaining traditional models of informed consent whilst suggesting that potential research recruits should be encouraged to discuss participation with their families. It is argued here that this may produce an unfair account of the responsibilities of research participants, that it may ignore the very many difficulties of communication within families about genetics and health, and that it may create unrealistic hurdles to the ethical conduct of research. Research conducted in the context of clinical genetics and on health communication more widely is drawn upon to illustrate these points. A clear recommendation is made that providing materials that may assist research participants to communicate with family members may be beneficial and may raise ethical standards, but that it may be unwise to burden participants with the suggestion that they owe specific obligations to genetic relatives to discuss research participation with them.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The objective of this systematic review is to evaluate the evidence for the safety of contraceptive use among women with endometrial hyperplasia. STUDY DESIGN: We searched the PubMed database for peer-reviewed articles published in any language from database inception through February 2009 concerning the safety of using any contraceptive method among women diagnosed with endometrial hyperplasia. We excluded case reports but included all other study designs. The quality of each individual piece of evidence was assessed using the United States Preventive Services Task Force grading system. RESULTS: We identified nine articles that met the criteria for review. Each study examined levonorgestrel intrauterine devices (LNG-IUDs); no studies were identified that examined other contraceptive methods. Overall, these studies suggest that LNG-IUD use is not associated with adverse health events among women diagnosed with endometrial hyperplasia. Disease regression with LNG-IUD use was observed in all women in seven studies, in 90% of women in one study, and in 67% of women in one study. Limitations of the studies include small sample sizes and lack of a comparison group or nonrandomized assignment to LNG-IUD. CONCLUSIONS: There is fair quality evidence indicating that use of the LNG-IUD is safe for women with endometrial hyperplasia and may have therapeutic benefits.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: To understand the translational trajectory of genomic tests in cancer screening, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment, we reviewed tests that have been assessed by recommendation and guideline developers. METHODS:  For each test, we marked translational milestones by determining when the genomic association with cancer was first discovered and studied in patients, and when a health application for a specified clinical use was successfully demonstrated and approved or cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration. To identify recommendations and guidelines, we reviewed the websites of cancer, genomic, and general guideline developers and professional organizations. We searched the in vitro diagnostics database of the US Food and Drug Administration for information, and we searched PubMed for translational milestones. Milestones were examined against type of recommendation, Food and Drug Administration approval or clearance, disease rarity, and test purpose. RESULTS: Of the 45 tests we identified, 9 received strong recommendations for their usage in clinical settings, 14 received positive but moderate recommendations, and 22 were not currently recommended. For 18 tests, two or more different sources had issued recommendations, with 67% concordance. Only five tests had Food and Drug Administration approval, and an additional five had clearance. The median time from discovery to recommendation statement was 14.7 years. CONCLUSION: In general, there were no associations found between translational trajectory and recommendation category.",

        "abstract": "For decades, culture has been the mainstay of diagnostic testing for bacterial enteric pathogens. This paradigm is changing as clinical laboratories adopt culture-independent methods, such as antigen-based tests and nucleic acid-based assays. Public health surveillance for enteric infections addresses 4 interrelated but distinct objectives: case investigation for localized disease control; assessment of disease burden and trends to prioritize and assess impact of population-based control measures; outbreak detection; and microbiologic characterization to improve understanding of pathogens, their virulence mechanisms, and epidemiology. We summarize the challenges and opportunities that culture-independent tests present and suggest strategies, such as validation studies and development of culture-independent tests compatible with subtyping, that could be adopted to ensure that surveillance remains robust. Many of these approaches will require time and resources to implement, but they will be necessary to maintain a strong surveillance system. Public health practitioners must clearly explain the value of surveillance, especially how outbreak detection benefits the public, and collaborate with all stakeholders to develop solutions.",

We surveyed household contacts of ill students to characterize the extent of transmission within households, identify contact groups at highest risk for illness, and assess the potential for preventing household transmission. Influenza-like illness (ILI) was reported by 79 of 702 household contacts (11.3% attack rate). Multivariate analysis showed that older age was protective: for each increasing year of age, the risk of ILI was reduced 5%. Additional protective factors included antiviral prophylaxis and having had a household discussion about influenza. Providing care for the index case patient and watching television with the index case patient were risk factors among parents and siblings, respectively. Fifty percent of cases occurred within 3 days of onset of illness in the student. These factors have implications for mitigating the impact of pH1N1 transmission.",

        "abstract": "Keratitis, inflammation of the cornea, can result in partial or total loss of vision and can result from infectious agents (e.g., microbes including bacteria, fungi, amebae, and viruses) or from noninfectious causes (e.g., eye trauma, chemical exposure, and ultraviolet exposure). Contact lens wear is the major risk factor for microbial keratitis; outbreaks of Fusarium and Acanthamoeba keratitis have been associated with contact lens multipurpose solution use, and poor contact lens hygiene is a major risk factor for a spectrum of eye complications, including microbial keratitis and other contact lens-related inflammation. However, the overall burden and the epidemiology of keratitis in the United States have not been well described. To estimate the incidence and cost of keratitis, national ambulatory-care and emergency department databases were analyzed. The results of this analysis showed that an estimated 930,000 doctor's office and outpatient clinic visits and 58,000 emergency department visits for keratitis or contact lens disorders occur annually; 76.5% of keratitis visits result in antimicrobial prescriptions. Episodes of keratitis and contact lens disorders cost an estimated $175 million in direct health care expenditures, including $58 million for Medicare patients and $12 million for Medicaid patients each year. Office and outpatient clinic visits occupied over 250,000 hours of clinician time annually. Developing effective prevention messages that are disseminated to contact lens users and investigation of additional preventive efforts are important measures to reduce the national incidence of microbial keratitis.",

        "abstract": "The self-controlled case series (SCCS) and self-controlled risk interval (SCRI) designs have recently become widely used in the field of post-licensure vaccine safety monitoring to detect potential elevated risks of adverse events following vaccinations. The SCRI design can be viewed as a subset of the SCCS method in that a reduced comparison time window is used for the analysis. Compared to the SCCS method, the SCRI design has less statistical power due to fewer events occurring in the shorter control interval. In this study, we derived the asymptotic relative efficiency (ARE) between these two methods to quantify this loss in power in the SCRI design. The equation is formulated as [Formula: see text] (a: control window length ratio between SCRI and SCCS designs; b: ratio of risk window length and control window length in the SCCS design; [Formula: see text]: relative risk of exposed window to control window). According to this equation, the relative efficiency declines as the ratio of control period length between SCRI and SCCS methods decreases, or with an increase in the relative risk [Formula: see text]. We provide an example utilizing data from the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) to study the potential elevated risk of febrile seizure following seasonal influenza vaccine in the 2010-2011 season.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) programs collect socio-demographic and HIV testing information similar to that collected by unlinked anonymous testing sero-surveillance (UAT) in antenatal settings. Zimbabwe evaluated the utility of PMTCT data in replacing UAT. METHODS: A UAT dataset was created by capturing socio-demographic, testing practices from the woman's booking-card and testing remnant blood at a laboratory from 1 June to 30 September 2012. PMTCT data were collected retrospectively from ANC registers. UAT and PMTCT data were linked by bar-code labels that were temporarily affixed to the ANC register. A questionnaire was used to obtain facility-level data at 53 sites. RESULTS: Pooled HIV prevalence was 15.8 % (95 % CI 15.3-16.4) among 17,349 women sampled by UAT, and 16.3 % (95 % CI 15.8 %-16.9 %) among 17,150 women in PMTCT datasets for 53 sites. Pooled national percent-positive agreement (PPA) was 91.2 %, and percent-negative agreement (PNA) was 98.7 % for 16,782 women with matched UAT and PMTCT data. Based on UAT methods, overall median prevalence was 12.9 % (Range 4.0 %-19.4 %) among acceptors and refusers of HIV test in PMTCT compared to 12.5 % ((Range 3.4 %-19.5 %) among acceptors in ANC registers. There were variations in prevalence by site. CONCLUSION: Although, there is no statistical difference between pooled HIV prevalence in UAT compared to PMTCT program, the overall PPA of 91.2 % and PNA of 98.7 % fall below World Health Organisation (WHO) benchmarks of 97.6 % and 99.6 % respectively. Zimbabwe will need to strengthen quality assurance (QA) of rapid HIV testing and data collection practices. Sites with good performance should be prioritised for transitioning.",

        "abstract": "A set of 270 bioaerosol samples was taken from 15 composting facilities using polystyrene closed-face filter cassettes (CFCs). The objective was to measure the quantity of endotoxin deposits on the inner surfaces of the cassettes (sometimes referred to as 'wall deposits'). The results show that endotoxins are deposited on the inner surfaces of the CFCs through sampling and/or handling of samples. The quantity of endotoxins measured on inner surfaces range between 0.05 (the limit of detection of the method) and 3100 endotoxin units per cassette. The deposits can represent a large and variable percentage of the endotoxins sampled. More than a third of the samples presented a percentage of inner surface deposits >40% of the total quantity of endotoxins collected (filter + inner surfaces). Omitting these inner surface deposits in the analytical process lead to measurement errors relative to sampling all particles entering the CFC sampler, corresponding to a developing consensus on matching the inhalable particulate sampling convention. The result would be underestimated exposures and could affect the decision as to whether or not a result is acceptable in comparison to airborne concentration limits defined in terms of the inhalability convention. The results of this study suggest including the endotoxins deposited on the inner surfaces of CFCs during analysis. Further researches are necessary to investigate endotoxin deposits on the inner cassette surfaces in other working sectors.",

        "abstract": "Triatomine bugs are a group of hematophagous arthropods that can serve as biological vectors for Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of American trypanosomiasis (Chagas disease). Because of differences in the biology and feeding habits among triatomine species, some are more likely than others to be involved in zoonotic and/or human-to-human transmission cycles of T. cruzi. In an attempt to assess the risk for Chagas disease exposure in south-central Texas, human habitations across Texas Health Service Region 8 (HSR 8) and surrounding counties were surveyed for triatomines to better characterize their geographic distribution, species-specific biology, and T. cruzi infection prevalence. Between May 2010 and August 2013, a total of 545 triatomines representing all 5 known indigenous species (Triatoma gerstaeckeri, Triatoma indictiva, Triatoma lecticularia, Triatoma sanguisuga, and Triatoma protracta woodi) were collected from 59 sites across the region. Triatoma gerstaeckeri was the species most commonly found in domestic and peridomestic ecotopes across Texas HSR 8, representing over 80% of the triatomines collected. Adult T. gerstaeckeri exhibited a seasonal dispersal pattern that began in late April, peaked in mid-May, and then continued into August. On homes with available crevices in the exterior walls, adult T. gerstaeckeri were observed emerging from or entering these protective microhabitats, suggesting possible opportunistic colonization of some exterior walls compartments. Laboratory testing of triatomine hindgut contents for T. cruzi by PCR demonstrated the adult T. gerstaeckeri infection prevalence across Texas HSR 8 to be 64%. Monitoring peridomestic adult T. gerstaeckeri over the seasonal dispersal peak demonstrated statistically significant increases in both their T. cruzi infection prevalence (p < 0.01) and tendency to invade human dwellings (p < 0.01) in the later aspect of the emergence peak. In addition to the adult insects, variably sized and staged nymphs were recovered from the inside of 6 separate homes across Texas HSR 8. The results of this study show that T. gerstaeckeri is a widespread and common triatomine species across Texas HSR 8 and documented it to have some notable synanthropic tendencies. The high prevalence of T. cruzi infection in native triatomines and the high frequency with which T. gerstaeckeri is recovered from human habitations, suggests that there is a risk for human exposure to T. cruzi in Texas HSR 8. Because of this, Chagas disease should be considered on the list of differential diagnoses for cases of cardiac arrhythmia, dilated cardiomyopathy, or heart failure in south-central Texas.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: High-molecular weight phthalates, such as diisononyl phthalate (DINP) and diisodecyl phthalate (DIDP), are used primarily as polyvinylchloride plasticizers. OBJECTIVES: To assess exposure to DINP and DIDP in a representative sample of persons aged 6 years and older in the U.S. general population from the 2005-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). METHODS: We analyzed 2,548 urine samples by using online solid-phase extraction coupled to isotope dilution-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: We detected monocarboxyisooctyl phthalate (MCOP), a metabolite of DINP, and monocarboxyisononyl phthalate (MCNP), a metabolite of DIDP, in 95.2% and 89.9% of the samples, respectively. We detected monoisononyl phthalate (MNP), a minor metabolite of DINP, much less frequently (12.9%) and at concentration ranges (>0.8 microg/L-148.1 microg/L) much lower than MCOP (>0.7 microg/L- 4,961 microg/L). Adjusted geometric mean concentrations of MCOP and MCNP were significantly higher (P<0.01) among children than among adolescents and adults. CONCLUSIONS: The general U.S. population, including children, was exposed to DINP and DIDP. In previous NHANES cycles, the occurrence of human exposure to DINP by using MNP as the sole urinary biomarker has been underestimated, thus illustrating the importance of selecting the most adequate biomarkers for exposure assessment.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To better understand risk behaviours and factors associated with low-fee female sex workers (FSW) and support HIV/sexually transmitted infections (STI) epidemic control among this key population in China. METHODS: A cross-sectional study using convenience sampling to recruit 1487 eligible low-fee and medium-fee FSW was conducted in 2012 in three provinces. The participants were interviewed using a structured questionnaire and tested for HIV-1, herpes simplex virus (HSV)-2 and syphilis antibody. Log-binomial modelling was used to estimate prevalence ratios (PR) and examine factors associated with low-fee sex work. RESULTS: Prevalence of HIV-1, syphilis and HSV-2 antibody positive were 0.5%, 4.8% and 27.8%, respectively. Low-fee FSW were more likely to have HSV-2 infection (adjusted prevalence ratio (APR)=1.3, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.7), but not more likely to have HIV-1 and syphilis infection compared with medium-fee FSW. Compared with medium-fee FSW, low-fee FSW were more likely to be >/=35 years of age (APR=2.1, 95% CI 1.3 to 3.6), engage in sex work >/=6 days/per week (APR=1.7, 95% CI 1.2 to 2.6), have >/=3 clients per day (APR=2.2, 95% CI 1.5 to 3.3), have clients decide condom use (APR=1.6, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.3), fail to persuade clients to use condoms (APR=1.6, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.6), express willingness to have unprotected sex in return for receipt of a higher fee (APR=1.8, 95% CI 1.2 to 2.8), have had genital symptoms in the past year (APR=1.4, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.8) and have migrated from another city. CONCLUSIONS: Low-fee FSW in China have unique risks for acquiring HIV/STI, in part due to greater economic pressures. Tailored interventions targeting low-fee FSW and incorporating their prevailing perception of HIV/STI risks and condom use negotiation challenges that they face are urgently needed.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: During annual influenza epidemics, rates of serious illness and death are higher among those who have medical conditions, such as pulmonary disease, diabetes, or heart disease, which place them at increased risk of influenza complications. Annual influenza vaccination was recommended for people with high-risk conditions as early as 1960. METHODS: Data from the 2012-2013 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System were analyzed in 2014 to estimate national and state-specific influenza vaccination coverage among people aged 18-64 years with high-risk conditions. Prevalence ratios adjusted for demographic and access-to-care characteristics were calculated using logistic regression and predictive marginal models. RESULTS: Unadjusted influenza vaccination coverage was 45.4% among adults aged 18-64 years with at least one high-risk condition, compared with 32.9% among those with no high-risk conditions (p<0.05). Among adults aged 18-64 years with multiple conditions (at least two high-risk conditions), vaccination coverage was 53.2%. Coverage was 43.9% for those with pulmonary diseases, 52.7% for those with diabetes, 48.1% for those with heart disease, and 45.0% for those with cancer. Individuals with high-risk conditions were more likely to receive an influenza vaccine than those with no high-risk conditions, even after controlling for demographic and access-to-care characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: Despite ongoing influenza vaccination recommendations for adults with high-risk conditions, coverage was below the Healthy People 2020 target; only about half were vaccinated. Primary care providers and subspecialists should ensure routine assessment of vaccination status every fall and winter and recommend vaccination to people with high-risk conditions.",

        "abstract": "RATIONALE: Harsh, abusive and rejecting behavior by parents toward their adolescents is associated with increased risk of many developmental problems for youth. OBJECTIVE: In the present study we address behaviors of co-parents that might help disrupt the hypothesized health risk of harsh parenting. METHOD: Data come from a community study of 451 early adolescents followed into adulthood. During early adolescence, observers rated both parents separately on harshness towards the adolescent. Adolescents reported on their physical health at multiple assessments from age 12 through age 20, and on parental warmth. RESULTS: Harsh parenting predicted declines in adolescent self-reported physical health and increases in adolescent body mass index (BMI). Although the health risk associated with harshness from one parent was buffered by warmth from the other parent, warmth from the second parent augmented the association between harshness from the first parent and change over time in adolescent BMI. CONCLUSION: As appropriate, preventive interventions should include a focus on spousal or partner behaviors in their educational or treatment programs. Additional research is needed on the association between self-reported physical health and BMI in adolescence.",

We performed a secondary analysis of data from the Mother's Gift project, a randomized study designed to test the effectiveness of inactivated influenza and pneumococcal vaccines during pregnancy. METHODS: In the Mother's Gift project, 340 pregnant women in Bangladesh received either inactivated influenza vaccine or 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (control). This study was performed from August 2004 through December 2005. We performed a secondary analysis of outcomes following maternal influenza immunization during two periods: when influenza virus was not circulating (September 2004 through January 2005) and when influenza virus was circulating (February through October 2005). We assessed gestational age, mean birth weight and the proportion of infants who were small for gestational age. RESULTS: During the period with no circulating influenza virus, there were no differences in the incidence of respiratory illness with fever per 100 person-months among mothers and infants in the two groups (influenza vaccine: 3.9; control: 4.0; p > 0.9). The proportion of infants who were small for gestational age and the mean birth weight were similar between groups (small for gestational age: influenza vaccine 29.1%, control 34.3%; mean birth weight: influenza vaccine 3083 g, control 3053 g). During the period with circulating influenza virus, there was a substantial reduction in the incidence per 100 person-months of respiratory illness with fever among the mothers and infants who had received the influenza vaccine (influenza vaccine: 3.7; control: 7.2; p = 0.0003). During this period, the proportion of infants who were small for gestational age was lower in the influenza vaccine group than in the control group (25.9% v. 44.8%; p = 0.03). The mean birth weight was higher among infants whose mothers received the influenza vaccine than among those who received the control vaccine during this period (3178 g v. 2978 g; p = 0.02). INTERPRETATION: During the period with circulating influenza virus, maternal immunization during pregnancy was associated with a lower proportion of infants who were small for gestational age and an increase in mean birth weight. These data need confirmation but suggest that prevention of influenza infection in pregnancy can influence intrauterine growth. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT 00142389.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: We examined utilization patterns of adolescents and young women as they seek general and reproductive health services in physician offices and hospital outpatient clinics. METHODS: We analyzed physician office visits in the 2003-2006 National Ambulatory Medical Care Surveys, and hospital outpatient clinic visits in the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Surveys, to examine utilization patterns of females aged 9-26 years by 2-year age intervals and other characteristics such as physician specialty or clinic type. RESULTS: The number of visits to primary care physician offices increased with age, from 4.9 million for ages 9-10 years to 9.0 million for ages 25-26 years. The proportion of visits made to obstetrician-gynecologists and family practitioners increased with age, and by ages 15-16 years fewer than half of all visits to primary care providers were made to pediatricians. The proportion of visits to family practitioners increased from 25% at ages 9-10 years to 30% at ages 25-26 years. By ages 17-18 years, a larger proportion of visits were made to obstetrician-gynecologists (33% of 7.0 million visits) and to family practitioners (34%) than to pediatricians (23%). The proportion of visits for reproductive health services peaked at 53% of 7.5 million physician visits at ages 20-21 years. Similar utilization patterns were observed for the 11.0 million hospital outpatient visits to primary care providers. CONCLUSIONS: Because adolescents and young women most commonly utilize healthcare services provided by obstetrician-gynecologists and family practitioners, these specialties should be priority targets for interventions to improve the quality and availability of reproductive health services.",

Although these methods are valuable, state-level program impact has not been evaluated quantitatively. Public health core and leadership competency assessments are administered pre and post Kansas Public Health Leadership Institute training (N = 94). Wilcoxon signed rank tests note significant increases by each competency domain. Data are stratified by years of experience, level of education, and urban or rural status, and correlations calculated using Spearman's rho tests in SPSS/PC 14.0. Post training, participants improve significantly in all competency domains (p < .001). Participants with lower education, fewer years of experience, and rural status improve more in certain core competency domains. Lower education and rural status correlate with greater improvement in certain leadership competency domains. Similar assessment methods can be used by other public health education programs to ensure that programs appropriately train specific work-force populations for national accreditation.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Local health departments (LHDs) can play an important role in linking people to personal health services and ensuring the provision of health care when it is otherwise unavailable. However, the extent to which LHDs are involved in ensuring access to health care in its jurisdictions is not well known. PURPOSE: To provide nationally representative estimates of LHD involvement in specific activities to ensure access to healthcare services and to assess their association with macro-environment/community and LHD capacity and process characteristics. METHODS: Data used were from the 2010 National Profile of Local Health Departments Study, Area Resource Files, and the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials' 2010 Profile of State Public Health Agencies Survey. Data were analyzed in 2012. RESULTS: Approximately 66.0% of LHDs conducted activities to ensure access to medical care, 45.9% to dental care, and 32.0% to behavioral health care. About 28% of LHDs had not conducted activities to ensure access to health care in their jurisdictions in 2010. LHDs with higher per capita expenditures and larger jurisdiction population sizes were more likely to provide access to care services (p <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: There is substantial variation in LHD engagement in activities to ensure access to care. Differences in LHD capacity and the needs of the communities in which they are located may account for this variation. Further research is needed to determine whether this variation is associated with adverse population health outcomes.",

        "abstract": "The incidence of and mortality from cerebrovascular diseases (CVD) have been studied in a cohort of 12,210 workers first employed at one of the main plants of the Mayak nuclear facility during 1948-1958 and followed up to 31 December 2000. Information on external gamma-ray doses is available for virtually all of these workers (99.9%); the mean total gamma-ray dose (+/- SD) was 0.91 +/- 0.95 Gy (99th percentile 3.9 Gy) for men and 0.65 +/- 0.75 Gy (99th percentile 2.99 Gy) for women. In contrast, plutonium body burden was measured only for 30.0% of workers; among those monitored, the mean cumulative liver dose from plutonium alpha-particle exposure (+/- SD) was 0.40 +/- 1.15 Gy (99th percentile 5.88 Gy) for men and 0.81 +/- 4.60 Gy (99th percentile 15.95 Gy) for women. A total of 4418 cases of CVD, including 665 cases of stroke, and 753 deaths from CVD, including 404 deaths from stroke, were identified in the study cohort. Having adjusted for non-radiation factors, there were statistically significant increasing trends in CVD incidence but not mortality with both total external gamma-ray dose and internal liver dose. Much of the evidence for increased incidence in relation to external dose arose for workers with cumulative doses above 1 Gy. Although the dose response is consistent with linearity, the statistical power to detect non-linearity at external doses below 1 Gy was low. CVD incidence was statistically significantly higher among workers with a plutonium liver dose above 0.1 Gy. There was a statistically significant increasing trend in incidence with increasing internal dose, even after adjusting for external dose, although the trend estimates differed between workers at different plants. The risk estimates for external radiation are generally compatible with those from other large occupational studies, although the incidence data point to higher risk estimates compared to those from the Japanese A-bomb survivors.",

        "abstract": "Influenza poses a significant health threat to children, and schools may play a critical role in community outbreaks. Mathematical outbreak models require assumptions about contact rates and patterns among students, but the level of temporal granularity required to produce reliable results is unclear. We collected objective contact data from students aged 5-14 at an elementary school and middle school in the state of Utah, USA, and paired those data with a novel, data-based model of influenza transmission in schools. Our simulations produced within-school transmission averages consistent with published estimates. We compared simulated outbreaks over the full resolution dynamic network with simulations on networks with averaged representations of contact timing and duration. For both schools, averaging the timing of contacts over one or two school days caused average outbreak sizes to increase by 1-8%. Averaging both contact timing and pairwise contact durations caused average outbreak sizes to increase by 10% at the middle school and 72% at the elementary school. Averaging contact durations separately across within-class and between-class contacts reduced the increase for the elementary school to 5%. Thus, the effect of ignoring details about contact timing and duration in school contact networks on outbreak size modelling can vary across different schools.",

By using US surveillance data (April 12, 2009-April 10, 2010) and vaccine coverage estimates (October 3, 2009-April 18, 2010), we estimated that the A(H1N1)pdm09 virus vaccination program prevented 700,000-1,500,000 clinical cases, 4,000-10,000 hospitalizations, and 200-500 deaths. We found that the national health effects were greatly influenced by the timing of vaccine administration and the effectiveness of the vaccine. We estimated that recommendations for priority vaccination of targeted priority groups were not inferior to other vaccination prioritization strategies. These results emphasize the need for relevant surveillance data to facilitate a rapid evaluation of vaccine recommendations and effects.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To identify demographic, behavioral, and psychological variables associated with being HIV-positive unaware among black and Latino men who have sex with men (MSM). METHODS: Participants recruited in 3 cities completed a computer-assisted interview and were tested for HIV infection (OraSure Technologies, Bethlehem, PA). HIV-positive unaware MSM were compared with MSM who tested HIV-negative in bivariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Of 1208 MSM (597 black and 611 Latino), 11% were HIV-positive unaware (18% of blacks and 5% of Latinos). In multivariate analysis of the Latino MSM, being HIV-positive unaware was associated with non-gay identity, high perceived risk of currently being HIV-positive, and belief that sex with other Latino men reduces HIV transmission risk. Among black MSM, being HIV-positive unaware was associated with gay identity, moderately higher income, having health insurance, sexuality disclosure to a current healthcare provider, fewer than 3 lifetime HIV tests, high perceived risk of testing HIV-positive, and belief that sex with other black men reduces HIV transmission risk. CONCLUSIONS: HIV prevention efforts should address misperceptions among those black and Latino MSM who believe that assortative (i.e. intraracial) sexual mixing reduces risk of HIV infection. Our findings also revealed missed opportunities to diagnose black MSM with HIV infection who were already engaged in care and had disclosed their sexuality to their healthcare provider. Clinicians should offer HIV testing to all MSM, particularly black MSM, who disclose engaging in recent sex with other men to facilitate earlier diagnosis of HIV infection and reduce transmission risk to sexual partners.",

        "abstract": "The aim of this study is to identify general properties of emerging infectious agents that determine the likely success of two simple public health measures in controlling outbreaks, namely (i) isolating symptomatic individuals and (ii) tracing and quarantining their contacts. Because these measures depend on the recognition of specific disease symptoms, we investigate the relative timing of infectiousness and the appearance of symptoms by using a mathematical model. We show that the success of these control measures is determined as much by the proportion of transmission occurring prior to the onset of overt clinical symptoms (or via asymptomatic infection) as the inherent transmissibility of the etiological agent (measured by the reproductive number R(0)). From published studies, we estimate these quantities for two moderately transmissible viruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and HIV, and for two highly transmissible viruses, smallpox and pandemic influenza. We conclude that severe acute respiratory syndrome and smallpox are easier to control using these simple public health measures. Direct estimation of the proportion of asymptomatic and presymptomatic infections is achievable by contact tracing and should be a priority during an outbreak of a novel infectious agent.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Understanding how hospitals functioned during the 2009 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic may improve future public health emergency response, but information about its impact on US hospitals remains largely unknown. RESEARCH DESIGN: We matched hospital and emergency department (ED) discharge data from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project with community-level influenza-like illness activity during each hospital's pandemic period in fall 2009 compared with a corresponding calendar baseline period. We compared inpatient mortality for sentinel conditions at high-surge versus nonsurge hospitals. RESULTS: US hospitals experienced a doubling of pneumonia and influenza ED visits during fall 2009 compared with prior years, along with an 18% increase in overall ED visits. Although no significant increase in total inpatient admissions occurred overall, approximately 10% of all study hospitals experienced high surge, associated with higher acute myocardial infarction and stroke case fatality rates. These hospitals had similar characteristics to other US hospitals except that they had higher mortality for acute cardiac illnesses before the pandemic. After adjusting for 2008 case fatality rates, the association between high-surge hospitals and increased mortality for acute myocardial infarction and stroke patients persisted. CONCLUSIONS: The fall 2009 pandemic period substantially impacted US hospitals, mostly through increased ED visits. For a small proportion of hospitals that experienced a high surge in inpatient admissions, increased mortality from selected clinical conditions was associated with both prepandemic outcomes and surge, highlighting the linkage between daily hospital operations and disaster preparedness.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Male circumcision confers protection against HIV, sexually transmitted infections, and urinary tract infections. Compared with circumcision of postneonates (>28 days), circumcision of neonates is associated with fewer complications and usually performed with local rather than general anesthesia. We assessed circumcision of commercially insured males during the neonatal or postneonatal period. METHODS: We analyzed 2010 MarketScan claims data from commercial health plans, using procedural codes to identify circumcisions performed on males aged 0 to 18 years, and diagnostic codes to assess clinical indications for the procedure. Among circumcisions performed in the first year of life, we estimated rates for neonates and postneonates. We estimated the percentage of circumcisions by age among males who had circumcisions in 2010, and the mean payment for neonatal and postneonatal procedures. RESULTS: We found that 156 247 circumcisions were performed, with 146 213 (93.6%) in neonates and 10 034 (6.4%) in postneonates. The neonatal circumcision rate was 65.7%, and 6.1% of uncircumcised neonates were circumcised by their first birthday. Among postneonatal circumcisions, 46.6% were performed in males younger than 1 year and 25.1% were for nonmedical indications. The mean payment was $285 for a neonatal and $1885 for a postneonatal circumcision. CONCLUSIONS: The large number of nonmedical postneonatal circumcisions suggests that neonatal circumcision might be a missed opportunity for these boys. Delay of nonmedical circumcision results in greater risk for the child, and a more costly procedure. Discussions with parents early in pregnancy might help them make an informed decision about circumcision of their child.",

        "abstract": "Nine gas metal arc welding (GMAW) processes for stainless steel were assessed for fume generation rates, fume generation rates per g of electrode consumed, and emission rates for hexavalent chromium (Cr6+). Elemental manganese, nickel, chromium, iron emissions per unit length of weld and labor plus consumables costs were similarly measured. Flux-cored arc welding and shielded metal arc (SMAW) processes were also studied. The objective was to identify the best welding processes for reducing workplace exposures, and estimate costs for all processes. Using a conical chamber, fumes were collected, weighed, recovered and analyzed by inductively-coupled atomic emission spectroscopy for metals, and by ion chromatography for Cr6+. GMAW processes used were Surface Tension Transfer, Regulated Metal Deposition, Cold Metal Transfer, short-circuit, axial spray, and pulsed spray modes. Flux-cored welding used gas shielding; SMAW used E308 rods. Costs were estimated as dollars per m length of a (1/4) in (6.3 mm) thick horizontal butt weld; equipment costs were estimated as ratios of new equipment costs to a 250 ampere capacity SMAW welding machine. Results indicate a broad range of fume emission factors for the processes studied. Fume emission rates per g of electrode were lowest for GMAW processes such as pulsed-spray mode (0.2 mg/g), and highest for SMAW (8 mg fume/g electrode). Emission rates of Cr6+ ranged from 50 to 7800 mug/min, and Cr6+ generation rates per g electrode ranged from 1 to 270mug/g. Elemental Cr generation rates spanned 13 to 330mug/g. Manganese emission rates ranged from 50 to 300mug/g. Nickel emission rates ranged from 4 to140 mug/g. Labor and consumables costs ranged from $3.15 (GMAW pulsed spray) to $7.40 (SMAW) per meter of finished weld, and were measured or estimated for all 11 processes tested. Equipment costs for some processes may be as much as 5 times the cost of a typical SMAW welding machine. The results show that all of the GMAW processes in this study can substantially reduce fume, Cr6+, manganese and costs relative to SMAW, the most commonly used welding process, and several have exceptional capabilities for reducing emissions.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Transmission of bloodborne pathogens due to breaches in infection control is becoming increasingly recognized as greater emphasis is placed on reducing health care-associated infections. Two women, aged 60 and 77 years, were diagnosed with acute hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection; both received chemotherapy at the same physician's office. Due to suspicion of health care-associated HBV transmission, a multidisciplinary team initiated an investigation of the hematology-oncology office practice. METHODS: We performed an onsite inspection and environmental assessment, staff interviews, records review, and observation of staff practices. Patients who visited the office practice between January 1, 2006 and March 3, 2009 were advised to seek testing for bloodborne pathogens. Patients and medical providers were interviewed. Specimens from HBV-infected patients were sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for HBV DNA testing and phylogenic analysis. RESULTS: Multiple breaches in infection control were identified, including deficient policies and procedures, improper hand hygiene, medication preparation in a blood processing area, common-use saline bags, and reuse of single-dose vials. The office practice was closed, and the physician's license was suspended. Out of 2,700 patients notified, test results were available for 1,394 (51.6%). Twenty-nine outbreak-associated HBV cases were identified. Specimens from 11 case-patients demonstrated 99.9%-100% nucleotide identity on phylogenetic analysis. CONCLUSION: Systematic breaches in infection control led to ongoing transmission of HBV infection among patients undergoing invasive procedures at the office practice. This investigation underscores the need for improved regulatory oversight of outpatient health care settings, improved infection control and injection safety education for health care providers, and the development of mechanisms for ongoing communication and cooperation among public health agencies.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although under debate, routine screening for intimate partner violence (IPV) is recommended in health care settings. This study explored the utility of different screening and referral strategies for women exposed to IPV in primary health care. METHODS: Using a randomized controlled trial design we compared two screening strategies (health care providers [HCP] versus audio computer-assisted self-interviews [A-CASI]) and three referral strategies (HCP alone, A-CASI referral with HCP endorsement, and A-CASI alone). English-speaking women who were 18 years and older and were attending women's health clinics at a public hospital were eligible to participate. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three study groups (HCP screen and referral, A-CASI screen and referral with HCP referral endorsement, and A-CASI screen and referral). Women were reinterviewed by telephone 1 week later. The primary outcome was rate of IPV disclosure; secondary outcomes were screening mode preference, reactions to IPV screening, and use of referral resources. RESULTS: Of the 129 eligible women, 126 women were enrolled (98%); 102 women (81% of those enrolled) completed the follow-up telephone interview. Disclosure rates were higher for women screened with A-CASI compared with HCP-screened women (21% vs. 9%; p = .07). Screening mode preference, impact of screening (positive and negative reactions), and rates of use of referral resources were similar between study groups. CONCLUSION: A-CASI tended to yield higher rates of IPV disclosure and similar rates of use of referral resources. A-CASI technology may be a practical way to screen for IPV.",

        "abstract": "Norovirus is the most common cause of sporadic gastroenteritis and outbreaks worldwide. The rapid identification of norovirus has important implications for infection prevention measures, and may reduce the need for additional diagnostic testing. The Xpert Norovirus Assay recently received FDA clearance for the detection and differentiation of norovirus genogroups I and II (GI and GII), which account for the vast majority of infections. In this study, we evaluated the performance of the Xpert Norovirus Assay with both fresh, prospectively collected (n=914) and frozen, archived (n=489) fecal specimens. A Centers for Disease Control (CDC) composite reference method was used as the gold standard for comparison. For both prospective and frozen specimens, the Xpert Norovirus Assay showed a positive percent agreement (PPA) and negative percent agreement (NPA) of 98.3% and 98.1% for GI, and 99.4% and 98.2% for GII, respectively. Norovirus prevalence in the prospective specimens (collected from March to May of 2014) was 9.9% (n=90), with the majority of positives caused by genogroup II (82%, n=74). The positive predictive value (PPV) of the Xpert Norovirus Assay was 75% for GI whereas it was 86.5% for GII positive specimens. The negative predictive value (NPV) for GI and GII was 100% and 99.9%, respectively.",

        "abstract": "A unique feature of influenza A virus (IAV) life cycle is replication of the viral genome in the host cell nucleus. The nuclear import of IAV genome is an indispensable step in establishing virus infection. IAV nucleoprotein (NP) is known to mediate the nuclear import of viral genome via its nuclear localization signals. Here, we demonstrate that cellular heat shock protein 40 (Hsp40/DnaJB1) facilitates the nuclear import of incoming IAV viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs) and is important for efficient IAV replication. Hsp40 was found to interact with NP component of IAV RNPs during early stages of infection. This interaction is mediated by the J domain of Hsp40 and N-terminal region of NP. Drug or RNAi mediated inhibition of Hsp40 resulted in reduced nuclear import of IAV RNPs, diminished viral polymerase function and attenuates overall viral replication. Hsp40 was also found to be required for efficient association between NP and importin alpha, which is crucial for IAV RNP nuclear translocation. These studies demonstrate an important role for cellular chaperone Hsp40/DnaJB1 in influenza A virus life cycle by assisting nuclear trafficking of viral ribonucleoproteins.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: National data indicate that the prevalence of non-cigarette tobacco product use is highest among young adults; however, little is known about their openness to use these products in the future and associated risk factors. This study sought to characterize openness to using non-cigarette tobacco products and associated factors among U.S. young adults. METHODS: In 2014, National Adult Tobacco Survey data (2012-2013) were analyzed to characterize openness to using the following tobacco products among all young adults aged 18-29 years (N=5,985): cigars; electronic cigarettes (\"e-cigarettes\"); hookah; pipe tobacco; chew, snuff, or dip; snus; and dissolvables. Among those who were not current users of each product, multivariable logistic regression was used to examine associations between demographics, cigarette smoking status, lifetime use of other non-cigarette products, perceived harm and addictiveness of smoking, and receipt of tobacco industry promotions and openness to using each product. RESULTS: Among all young adults, openness to using non-cigarette tobacco products was greatest for hookah (28.2%); e-cigarettes (25.5%); and cigars (19.1%). In multivariable analyses, which included non-current users of each product, non-current ever, current, and former smokers were more likely than never smokers to be open to using most examined products, as were men and adults aged 18-24 years. Receipt of tobacco industry promotions was associated with openness to using e-cigarettes; chew, snuff, or dip; and snus. CONCLUSIONS: There is substantial openness to trying non-cigarette tobacco products among U.S. young adults. Young adults are an important population to consider for interventions targeting non-cigarette tobacco product use.",

Pre-sampling contamination of filter media used for sampling (1 --> 3)-beta-D-glucan may lead to substantial exposure measurement errors. Using the Limulus amebocyte lysate assay, we tested for pre-sampling levels of (1 --> 3)-beta-D-glucan on three types of filters-mixed cellulose ester (MCE)[1 brand], glass fiber (GF)[1 brand], and polycarbonate (PC)[5 brands]. Levels of (1 --> 3)-beta-D-glucan on MCE filters exceeded 4586.1 pg per filter. Levels on GF filters averaged 135.3 (+/-28.9) pg per filter (range = 94.8-160.4 pg per filter) and levels on PC filters averaged 152.4 (+/-236.1) pg per filter (range = non-detectable-1760.7 pg per filter). Efforts to clean MCE and GF filters were unfeasible or unsuccessful. Sonicating PC filters for two hours in ethanol, followed by a wash in pyrogen-free water, effectively eliminated measured levels of (1 --> 3)-beta-D-glucan on four brands of PC filters, as compared to untreated PC filters. This pretreatment process did not appear to physically damage the PC filters. Air sampling results highlighted the potentially problematic contamination of untreated PC filters. Ensuring that sampling media are free of (1 --> 3)-beta-D-glucan before sampling is crucial to accurately measure levels of (1 --> 3)-beta-D-glucan exposure, especially in environments where levels of (1 --> 3)-beta-D-glucan are low.",

        "abstract": "Lymphatic filariasis (LF), also known as elephantiasis, results from mosquito-borne infection with filarial worm parasites, predominantly Wuchereria bancrofti, and can lead to severe disfigurement from lymphedema and hydrocele. The World Health Organization (WHO) has called for the elimination of LF using the strategy of annual mass drug administration (MDA). WHO defines adequate MDA coverage (the percentage of all residents of an endemic area who swallow the drugs) as >/=65%. By late 2011, all areas in Haiti where LF is endemic had received MDA, except Port-au-Prince, which was considered the most challenging area. The first MDA in Port-au-Prince was conducted from November 2011 through February 2012. To evaluate coverage, a stratified, three-stage cluster-sample survey was conducted. In all, 71% (95% confidence interval = 69%-74%) of persons swallowed the MDA tablets, according to their own or a proxy respondent's recall. Coverage was highest (77%) among internally displaced persons (IDPs) in camps, and <65% in two of the remaining six survey strata (urban communes). Among the 1,976 adults asked additional questions, 88% said they heard about the MDA before it happened, 74% that they were given tablets, and 71% that they swallowed the tablets. Only 50% of those who did not hear about the MDA in advance swallowed the tablets. The MDA was a large step toward the elimination of LF in Haiti but must be followed by MDA rounds that maintain adequate coverage.",

        "abstract": "In the spring of 2009, a novel influenza A (H1N1) virus emerged in North America and spread worldwide to cause the first influenza pandemic since 1968. During the first 4 months, over 500 deaths in the United States had been associated with confirmed 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) [2009 H1N1] virus infection. Pathological evaluation of respiratory specimens from initial influenza-associated deaths suggested marked differences in viral tropism and tissue damage compared with seasonal influenza and prompted further investigation. Available autopsy tissue samples were obtained from 100 US deaths with laboratory-confirmed 2009 H1N1 virus infection. Demographic and clinical data of these case-patients were collected, and the tissues were evaluated by multiple laboratory methods, including histopathological evaluation, special stains, molecular and immunohistochemical assays, viral culture, and electron microscopy. The most prominent histopathological feature observed was diffuse alveolar damage in the lung in all case-patients examined. Alveolar lining cells, including type I and type II pneumocytes, were the primary infected cells. Bacterial co-infections were identified in >25% of the case-patients. Viral pneumonia and immunolocalization of viral antigen in association with diffuse alveolar damage are prominent features of infection with 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus. Underlying medical conditions and bacterial co-infections contributed to the fatal outcome of this infection. More studies are needed to understand the multifactorial pathogenesis of this infection.",

        "abstract": "Effective early detection strategies for ovarian cancer do not exist. Current screening guidelines recommend against routine screening using CA-125 alone or in combination with transvaginal ultrasonography (TVS). In this study, the authors used the 2008 DocStyles survey to measure clinician beliefs about the effectiveness of CA-125 and TVS in the asymptomatic, average-risk population in the United States. To assess the need for provider education, the authors used the 2008 HealthStyles survey to examine public awareness of CA-125. Of 1,250 physician respondents, 40.4% said both CA-125 and TVS were effective screens, and 28.3% said neither was an effective ovarian cancer screen in the asymptomatic, average-risk population. Obstetrician/gynecologists [OB/GYNs] more often had responses consistent with current guidelines: 56.5% of OB/GYNs, compared with 34.4% and 29.8% of family/general practitioners and internists, respectively, said neither CA-125 nor TVS was an effective screen. Almost one third of women surveyed reported having heard of CA-125, and about one tenth said they had the CA-125 test. These findings support the need for additional provider education. Educational efforts should include lack of evidence for, as well as the potential harms of, screening for ovarian cancer with CA-125.",

        "abstract": "Vaccine safety fears following media reports of adverse events led to low (50.3%) coverage in a supplementary measles-rubella immunization campaign in Georgia in 2008. Review of adverse events associated with the campaign identified 432 reports (<0.1% of approximately 493,000 vaccinees) including 338 (78.2%) cases of syncope. There were no deaths. Causality assessment was performed for 79 cases perceived by providers as severe and with clinical details available. Conditions likely caused by the vaccine were identified in 13 (16.5%) cases (allergic and local reactions, thrombocytopenia). Thirty-seven (46.8%) cases had symptoms consistent with syncope or anxiety attack; 36 (97.3%) of them were initially misdiagnosed as anaphylactic shock/allergies/\"postvaccinal reactions\". Twenty-nine (36.7%) cases had coincidental illnesses. Safety fears were unfounded and exaggerated by media reports and providers' difficulties in recognizing syncope/anxiety attacks. Risk communication strategies to address perceived vaccine safety concerns are urgently needed to ensure that the goal of measles and rubella elimination in the European Region of the World Health Organization is met.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are persistent, bioaccumulative, and endocrine-disrupting chemicals. OBJECTIVES: We used handwipes to estimate exposure to PBDEs in house dust among toddlers and examined sex, age, breast-feeding, race, and parents' education as predictors of serum PBDEs. METHODS: Eighty-three children from 12 to 36 months of age were enrolled in North Carolina between May 2009 and November 2010. Blood, handwipe, and house dust samples were collected and analyzed for PBDEs. A questionnaire was administered to collect demographic data. RESULTS: PBDEs were detected in all serum samples (geometric mean for SigmapentaBDE in serum was 43.3 ng/g lipid), 98% of the handwipe samples, and 100% of the dust samples. Serum SigmapentaBDEs were significantly correlated with both handwipe and house dust SigmapentaBDE levels, but were more strongly associated with handwipe levels (r = 0.57; p < 0.001 vs. r = 0.35; p < 0.01). Multivariate model estimates revealed that handwipe levels, child's sex, child's age, and father's education accounted for 39% of the variation in serum SigmaBDE3 levels (sum of BDEs 47, 99, and 100). In contrast, age, handwipe levels, and breast-feeding duration explained 39% of the variation in serum BDE 153. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that hand-to-mouth activity may be a significant source of exposure to PBDEs. Furthermore, age, socioeconomic status, and breast-feeding were significant predictors of exposure, but associations varied by congener. Specifically, serum SigmaBDE3 was inversely associated with socioeconomic status, whereas serum BDE-153 was positively associated with duration of breast-feeding and mother's education.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To examine preventive care visit patterns among commercially insured adolescents during 2003-2010. In 2005-2007, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended 3 vaccines targeted at adolescents. We also investigate the relationship between preventive care visits and immunization. STUDY DESIGN: Data were drawn from the MarketScan database. Adolescents aged 11-21 continuously enrolled in the same insurance plan during the calendar year were included. We calculated the annual proportion of adolescents with at least 1 preventive and 1 vaccination-related visit. Longitudinal analyses were conducted by following the 1992 birth cohort for 8 consecutive years. RESULTS: The proportion of adolescents making at least 1 preventive visit increased from 24.6%-41.1% during 2003-2010. The rate of vaccination-related visits increased from 12.9%-26.3%. The magnitude of the increase in preventive and vaccination-related visits was greater during the years in which ACIP issued recommendations. The rates of preventive and vaccination-related visits were considerably higher among female and early adolescents and adolescents in managed care plans. Longitudinal analyses indicated that only 2.4% of adolescents had an annual preventive visit during the 8 years. CONCLUSIONS: Yearly improvements in preventive care visits by adolescents were substantial. ACIP recommendations may be associated with this improvement. However, ongoing efforts are needed to improve the use and delivery of preventive care services.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Because of health disparities, incarcerated persons are at higher risk for multiple health issues, including HIV. Correctional facilities have an opportunity to provide HIV services to an underserved population. This article describes Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-funded HIV testing and service delivery in correctional facilities. METHODS: Data on HIV testing and service delivery were submitted to CDC by 61 health department jurisdictions in 2013. HIV testing, HIV positivity, receipt of test results, linkage, and referral services were described, and differences across demographic characteristics for linkage and referral services were assessed. Finally, trends were examined for HIV testing, HIV positivity, and linkage from 2009 to 2013. RESULTS: Of CDC-funded tests in 2013 among persons 18 years and older, 254,719 (7.9%) were conducted in correctional facilities. HIV positivity was 0.9%, and HIV positivity for newly diagnosed persons was 0.3%. Blacks accounted for the highest percentage of HIV-infected persons (1.3%) and newly diagnosed persons (0.5%). Only 37.9% of newly diagnosed persons were linked within 90 days; 67.5% were linked within any time frame; 49.7% were referred to partner services; and 45.2% were referred to HIV prevention services. There was a significant percent increase in HIV testing, overall HIV positivity, and linkage from 2009 to 2013. However, trends were stable for newly diagnosed persons. CONCLUSIONS: Identification of newly diagnosed persons in correctional facilities has remained stable from 2009 to 2013. Correctional facilities seem to be reaching blacks, likely due to higher incarceration rates. The current findings indicate that improvements are needed in HIV testing strategies, service delivery during incarceration, and linkage to care postrelease.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To improve our understanding of climate variability and diarrheal disease at the community level and inform predictions for future climate change scenarios, we examined whether the El Nino climate pattern is associated with increased rates of diarrhea among Peruvian children. METHODS: We analyzed daily surveillance data for 367 children aged 0 to 12 years from 2 cohorts in a peri-urban shantytown in Lima, Peru, 1995 through 1998. We stratified diarrheal incidence by 6-month age categories, season, and El Nino, and modeled between-subject heterogeneity with random effects Poisson models. RESULTS: Spring diarrheal incidence increased by 55% during El Nino compared with before El Nino. This increase was most acute among children older than 60 months, for whom the risk of a diarrheal episode during the El Nino spring was nearly 100% greater (relative risk = 1.96; 95% confidence interval = 1.24, 3.09). CONCLUSIONS: El Nino-associated climate variability affects community rates of diarrhea, particularly during the cooler seasons and among older children. Public health officials should develop preventive strategies for future El Nino episodes to mitigate the increased risk of diarrheal disease in vulnerable communities. (Am J Public Health.

Experiences during the birth hospitalization affect a mother's ability to establish and maintain breastfeeding. The Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative is a global program launched by the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children's Fund, and has at its core the Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding (Ten Steps), which describe evidence-based hospital policies and practices that have been shown to improve breastfeeding outcomes. METHODS: Since 2007, CDC has conducted the biennial Maternity Practices in Infant Nutrition and Care (mPINC) survey among all birth facilities in all states, the District of Columbia, and territories. CDC analyzed data from 2007 (baseline), 2009, 2011, and 2013 to describe trends in the prevalence of facilities using maternity care policies and practices that are consistent with the Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding. RESULTS: The percentage of hospitals that reported providing prenatal breastfeeding education (range = 91.1%-92.8%) and teaching mothers breastfeeding techniques (range = 87.8%-92.2%) was high at baseline and across all survey years. Implementation of the other eight steps was lower at baseline. From 2007 to 2013, six of these steps increased by 10-21 percentage points, although limiting non-breast milk feeding of breastfed infants and fostering post-discharge support only increased by 5-6 percentage points. Nationally, hospitals implementing more than half of the Ten Steps increased from 28.7% in 2007 to 53.9% in 2013. CONCLUSIONS: Maternity care policies and practices supportive of breastfeeding are improving nationally; however, more work is needed to ensure all women receive optimal breastfeeding support during the birth hospitalization. IMPLICATIONS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH PRACTICE: Because of the documented benefits of breastfeeding to both mothers and children, and because experiences in the first hours and days after birth help determine later breastfeeding outcomes, improved hospital policies and practices could increase rates of breastfeeding nationwide, contributing to improved child health.",

        "abstract": "In the past 2 years, CDC has learned of several clusters of respiratory illness associated with human enterovirus 68 (HEV68), including severe disease. HEV68 is a unique enterovirus that shares epidemiologic and biologic features with human rhinoviruses (HRV). First isolated in California in 1962 from four children with bronchiolitis and pneumonia, HEV68 has been reported rarely since that time and the full spectrum of illness that it can cause is unknown. The six clusters of respiratory illness associated with HEV68 described in this report occurred in Asia, Europe, and the United States during 2008-2010. HEV68 infection was associated with respiratory illness ranging from relatively mild illness that did not require hospitalization to severe illness requiring intensive care and mechanical ventilation. Three cases, two in the Philippines and one in Japan, were fatal. In these six clusters, HEV68 disproportionately occurred among children. CDC learned of clusters of HEV68 from public health agencies requesting consultation or diagnostic assistance and from reports presented at scientific conferences. In each cluster, HEV68 was diagnosed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing targeting the 5'-nontranslated region, followed by partial sequencing of the structural protein genes, VP4-VP2, VP1, or both, to give definitive, enterovirus type-specific information. This report highlights HEV68 as an increasingly recognized cause of respiratory illness. Clinicians should be aware of HEV68 as one of many causes of viral respiratory disease and should report clusters of unexplained respiratory illness to the appropriate public health agency.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The Binational Border Infectious Disease Surveillance program began surveillance for Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (SARI) on the U.S.-Mexico border in 2009. Here we describe patients in Southern Arizona. METHODS: Patients admitted to five acute care hospitals that met the SARI case definition (temperature >37.8 degrees C or reported fever or chills with history of cough, sore throat, or shortness of breath in a hospitalized person) were enrolled. Staff completed a standard form and collected a nasopharyngeal swab which was tested for selected respiratory viruses by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: From October 2010-September 2014, we enrolled 332 SARI patients. Fifty-two percent were male; 48% white non-Hispanic. The median age was 63 years (47% >65 years and 5.2% <5 years). During hospitalization, 51/230 (22%) patients required intubation, 120/297 (40%) were admitted to ICU, and 28/278 (10%) died. Influenza vaccination was 56%. Of 309 cases tested, 49 (16%) were positive for influenza viruses, 25 (8.1%) for human metapneumovirus (HMPV), 20 (6.5%) for parainfluenza viruses, 16 (5.2%) for coronavirus, 11 (3.6%) for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), 10 (3.2%) for rhinovirus, 4 (1.3%) for rhinovirus/enterovirus, 3 (1.0%) for enteroviruses, and 3 (1.0%) for adenovirus. Among the 49 influenza positive specimens, 76% were influenza A (19 H3N2, 17 H1N1pdm09, and 1 not subtyped), and 24% were influenza B. CONCLUSION: Influenza viruses were a frequent cause of SARI in hospitalized patients in Southern Arizona. Monitoring respiratory illness in border populations will help better understand the etiologies. Improving influenza vaccination coverage may help prevent some SARI cases.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rates of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) varied among the United States before pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) introduction. We compared trends in IPD rates among diverse US sites over 10 years since PCV7 introduction. METHODS: Patients with IPD of all ages were identified through active population and laboratory-based surveillance in 8 geographic areas under continuous surveillance during 1998-2009. Isolates were serotyped. IPD incidence rates and percent changes were calculated by site, serotype group, age, and year. RESULTS: Reductions in rates of IPD ranged, by site, from 19 to 29.9 cases per 100,000 population during 1998-1999 to 11.2-18.0 cases per 100,000 population during 2009 (rate reduction, 5.1-15.3 cases per 100,000 population). Reductions in IPD rates among children aged <5 years ranged from 35.7 to 117.2 cases per 100,000 population across the sites. Reductions in rates of IPD due to PCV7 serotypes were seen in all age groups at all sites, ranging from 12 to 21.4 cases per 100,000 population during 1998-1999 to <2 cases per 100,000 population during 2009 (92%-98% reductions). Serotype 19A rates ranged from 0.4 to 1.5 cases per 100,000 population during 1998-1999 to 1.3 to 3.4 cases per 100,000 population during 2009 (rate difference, 0.9-2.8 cases per 100,000 population); modest increases were observed for most age groups across the sites. Rates of IPD due to all other serotypes ranged from 6.3 to 10.3 cases per 100,000 population during 1998-1999 to 8.3-13.6 cases per 100,000 population during 2009 (rate difference, -0.4 to 5.7 cases per 100,000 population). Across the sites, the greatest rate increases were seen in the 50-64 and >65 year age groups. CONCLUSIONS: Reductions in IPD due to vaccine serotypes were consistent across sites. Changes in serotype 19A and all other serotypes were variable. Although relative increases in non-vaccine type serotypes were large in some sites, absolute rate increases were small.",

        "abstract": "Masonry workers face some of the highest physical demands in the construction industry where large bags of masonry material weighing 42.7 kg are commonly handled by mason tenders who mix the mortar, distribute mortar and bricks/blocks, and erect/dismantle scaffolding throughout the day. The objective of this study was to determine the effectiveness of using half-weight bags (21.4 kg) on reducing the biomechanical loading, physiological response, and perceived exertions. Ten male subjects performed asymmetric lifting tasks simulating unloading bags from a pallet. Muscle activity, trunk kinematics, heart rate, blood pressure and subjective rating data were collected. Spine loads were predicted from a well-validated EMG-assisted model. Bag weight, lift type, bag height at origin, and asymmetry at destination significantly impacted the spine loads. While there was a 50% reduction in bag weight, the peak loads for the half-weight bags were only 25% less than the more available full-weight bags (a reduction of about 320 N of shear and 1000 N of compression). Lifts allowing movement of the feet reduced the loads by about 22% in shear and 27% in compression compared to constrained postures. Interestingly, cumulative spine loads were greater for the lighter bags than the heavy bags ( approximately 40%). The subjective ratings of exertion and risk were significantly lower for the lighter bags. RELEVANCE TO INDUSTRY: The reduction in peak spine loading for the half-weight bags, particularly at the higher heights and when the feet were allowed to move could significantly reduce the injuries of masonry workers. However, there were trade-offs with cumulative loads that may minimize the reduced risk. Overall, given the limited amount of time lifting bags, the reduction of peak loads.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In recent years there has been an exponential increase in tungsten demand, potentially increasing human exposure to the metal. Currently, the toxicology of tungsten is poorly understood, but mounting evidence suggests that both the elemental metal and its alloys have cytotoxic effects. Here, we investigate the association between tungsten and cardiovascular disease (CVD) or stroke using six waves of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).  METHODS: We investigated associations using crude and adjusted logistic regression models in a cohort of 8614 adults (18–74 years) with 193 reported stroke diagnoses and 428 reported diagnoses of CVD. We also stratified our data to characterize associations in a subset of younger individuals (18–50 years).  RESULTS: Elevated tungsten concentrations were strongly associated with an increase in the prevalence of stroke, independent of typical risk factors (Odds Ratio (OR): 1.66, 95% Confidence Interval (95% CI): 1.17, 2.34). The association between tungsten and stroke in the young age category was still evident (OR: 2.17, 95% CI: 1.33, 3.53).  CONCLUSION: This study represents the most comprehensive analysis of the human health effects of tungsten to date. Individuals with higher urinary tungsten concentrations have double the odds of reported stroke. We hypothesize that the pathological pathway resulting from tungsten exposure may involve oxidative stress.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The American Cancer Society, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Cancer Institute (NCI), and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR) collaborate annually to provide updated information regarding cancer occurrence and trends in the United States. This year's report includes trends in colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and death rates and highlights the use of microsimulation modeling as a tool for interpreting past trends and projecting future trends to assist in cancer control planning and policy decisions. METHODS: Information regarding invasive cancers was obtained from the NCI, CDC, and NAACCR; and information on deaths was obtained from the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics. Annual percentage changes in the age-standardized incidence and death rates (based on the year 2000 US population standard) for all cancers combined and for the top 15 cancers were estimated by joinpoint analysis of long-term trends (1975-2006) and for short-term fixed-interval trends (1997-2006). All statistical tests were 2-sided. RESULTS: Both incidence and death rates from all cancers combined significantly declined (P < .05) in the most recent time period for men and women overall and for most racial and ethnic populations. These decreases were driven largely by declines in both incidence and death rates for the 3 most common cancers in men (ie, lung and prostate cancers and CRC) and for 2 of the 3 leading cancers in women (ie, breast cancer and CRC). The long-term trends for lung cancer mortality in women had smaller and smaller increases until 2003, when there was a change to a nonsignificant decline. Microsimulation modeling demonstrates that declines in CRC death rates are consistent with a relatively large contribution from screening and with a smaller but demonstrable impact of risk factor reductions and improved treatments. These declines are projected to continue if risk factor modification, screening, and treatment remain at current rates, but they could be accelerated further with favorable trends in risk factors and higher utilization of screening and optimal treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Although the decrease in overall cancer incidence and death rates is encouraging, rising incidence and mortality for some cancers are of concern.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Many individuals have not received recommended colorectal cancer (CRC) screening before they become Medicare eligible at the age of 65. We aimed to estimate the long-term implications of increased CRC screening in the pre-Medicare population (50-64 y) on costs in the pre-Medicare and Medicare populations (65+ y). METHODS: We used 2 independently developed microsimulation models [Microsimulation Screening Analysis Colon (MISCAN) and Simulation Model of CRC (SimCRC)] to project CRC screening and treatment costs under 2 scenarios, starting in 2010: \"current trends\" (60% of the population up-to-date with screening recommendations) and \"enhanced participation\" (70% up-to-date). The population was scaled to the projected US population for each year between 2010 and 2060. Costs per year were derived by age group (50-64 and 65+ y). RESULTS: By 2060, the discounted cumulative total costs in the pre-Medicare population were $35.7 and $28.1 billion higher with enhanced screening participation, than in the current trends scenario ($252.1 billion with MISCAN and $239.5 billion with SimCRC, respectively). Because of CRC treatment savings with enhanced participation, cumulative costs in the Medicare population were $18.3 and $32.7 billion lower (current trends: $423.5 billion with MISCAN and $372.8 billion with SimCRC). Over the 50-year time horizon an estimated 60% (MISCAN) and 89% (SimCRC) of the increased screening costs could be offset by savings in Medicare CRC treatment costs. CONCLUSION: Increased CRC screening participation in the pre-Medicare population could reduce CRC incidence and mortality, whereas the additional screening costs can be largely offset by long-term Medicare treatment savings.",

        "abstract": "CONTEXT: Adolescence marks a time when many young people engage in risky behaviors with potential implications for long-term health. Interventions focused on adolescents' parents and other caregivers have the potential to affect adolescents across a variety of risk and health-outcome areas. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Community Guide methods were used to evaluate the effectiveness of caregiver-targeted interventions in addressing adolescent risk and protective behaviors and health outcomes. Sixteen studies published during the search period (1966-2007) met review requirements and were included in this review. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Effectiveness was assessed based on changes in whether or not adolescents engaged in specified risk and protective behaviors; frequency of risk and protective behaviors, and health outcomes, also informed the results. Results from qualifying studies provided sufficient evidence that interventions delivered person-to-person (i.e., through some form of direct contact rather than through other forms of contact such as Internet or paper) and designed to modify parenting skills by targeting parents and other caregivers are effective in improving adolescent health. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions delivered to parents and other caregivers affect a cross-cutting array of adolescent risk and protective behaviors to yield improvements in adolescent health. Analysis from this review forms the basis of the recommendation by the Community Preventive Services Task Force presented elsewhere in this issue.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The prevalence of esophageal atresia (EA) has been shown to vary across different geographical settings. Investigation of geographical differences may provide an insight into the underlying etiology of EA. METHODS: The study population comprised infants diagnosed with EA during 1998 to 2007 from 18 of the 46 birth defects surveillance programs, members of the International Clearinghouse for Birth Defects Surveillance and Research. Total prevalence per 10,000 births for EA was defined as the total number of cases in live births, stillbirths, and elective termination of pregnancy for fetal anomaly (ETOPFA) divided by the total number of all births in the population. RESULTS: Among the participating programs, a total of 2943 cases of EA were diagnosed with an average prevalence of 2.44 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.35-2.53) per 10,000 births, ranging between 1.77 and 3.68 per 10,000 births. Of all infants diagnosed with EA, 2761 (93.8%) were live births, 82 (2.8%) stillbirths, 89 (3.0%) ETOPFA, and 11 (0.4%) had unknown outcomes. The majority of cases (2020, 68.6%), had a reported EA with fistula, 749 (25.5%) were without fistula, and 174 (5.9%) were registered with an unspecified code. CONCLUSIONS: On average, EA affected 1 in 4099 births (95% CI, 1 in 3954-4251 births) with prevalence varying across different geographical settings, but relatively consistent over time and comparable between surveillance programs. Findings suggest that differences in the prevalence observed among programs are likely to be attributable to variability in population ethnic compositions or issues in reporting or registration procedures of EA, rather than a real risk occurrence difference.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Three U.S. surveillance systems-National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), and Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)--estimate physical activity prevalence. METHODS: Survey differences were examined qualitatively. Prevalence estimates by sex, age, and race/ethnicity were assessed for comparable survey periods. Trends were examined from NHIS 1998 to 2007, NHANES 1999 to 2006, and BRFSS 2001 to 2007. RESULTS: Age-adjusted prevalence estimates appeared most similar for NHIS 2005 (physically active: 30.2%, inactive: 40.7%) and NHANES 2005 to 2006 (physically active: 33.5%, inactive: 32.4%). In BRFSS 2005, prevalence of being physically active was 48.3% and inactive was 13.9%. Across all systems, men were more likely to be active than women; non-Hispanic whites were most likely to be active; as age increased, overall prevalence of being active decreased. Prevalence of being active exhibited a significant increasing trend only in BRFSS 2001 to 2007 (P < .001), while prevalence of being inactive decreased significantly in NHANES 1999 to 2006 (P < .001) and BRFSS 2001 to 2007 (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Different ways of assessing physical activity in surveillance systems result in different prevalence estimates. Before comparing estimates from different systems, all aspects of data collection and data analysis should be examined to determine if comparisons are appropriate.",

        "abstract": "Postsurgical chemotherapy is guideline-recommended therapy for stage III colon cancer patients. Factors associated with patients not receiving adjuvant chemotherapy were identified in numerous studies; comorbidity was recognized as an important factor besides patient's age. We assessed the association between comorbidity and the use of adjuvant chemotherapy and type of chemotherapy regimen. Stage III colon cancer patients who underwent surgical resection were obtained from ten Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-NPCR Specialized Registries which participated in the Comparative Effectiveness Research (CER) project. Comorbidity was classified into no comorbidity recorded, Charlson, non-Charlson comorbidities, number, and severity of Charlson comorbidity. Pearson chi-square test and multivariable logistic regression were employed. Of 3180 resected stage III colon cancer patients, 64% received adjuvant chemotherapy. After adjusting for patient's demographic and tumor characteristics, there were no significant differences in receipt of chemotherapy between Charlson and non-Charlson comorbidity. However, patients who had two or more Charlson comorbidities or had moderate to severe disease were significantly less likely to have chemotherapy (ORs 0.69 [95% CI, 0.51-0.92] and 0.62 [95% CI, 0.42-0.91], respectively) when compared with those with non-Charlson comorbidity. In addition, those with moderate or severe comorbidities were more likely to receive single chemotherapy agent (P < 0.0001). Capecitabine and FOLFOX were the most common single- and multi-agent regimens regardless of type of comorbidity grouping. Both the number and severity of comorbidity were significantly associated with receipt of guideline-recommended chemotherapy and type of agent in stage III resected colon cancer patients. Better personalized care based on individual patient's condition ought to be recognized.",

        "abstract": "Evidence from varied community settings has shown that the Group Lifestyle Balance (GLB) Program and other adaptations of the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) intervention are effective in lowering diabetes risk. Most DPP data originated from studies of pre-diabetic whites, with only sparse evidence of the effect of DPP in African Americans (AAs) in community settings. This paper describes the design, methods, baseline characteristics and cost effective measures, of a single-blinded, cluster-randomized trial of a faith-based adaptation of the GLB program, Fit Body and Soul (FBAS). The major aims are to test efficacy and cost utility of FBAS in twenty AA churches. Randomization occurred at the church level and 604 AA overweight/obese (BMI>/=25kg/m) adults with fasting plasma glucose range from normal to pre-diabetic received either FBAS or a health-education comparison program. FBAS is a group-based, multi-level intervention delivered by trained church health advisors (health professionals from within the church), with the goal of >/=7% weight loss, achieved through increasing physical activity, healthy eating and behavior modification. The primary outcome is weight change at 12weeks post intervention. Secondary outcomes include hemoglobin A1C, fasting plasma glucose, waist circumference, blood pressure, physical activity level, quality of life measures, and cost-effectiveness. FBAS is the largest known cohort of AAs enrolled in a faith-based DPP translation. Reliance on health professionals from within the church for program implementation and the cost analysis are unique aspects of this trial. The design provides a model for faith-based DPPs and holds promise for program sustainability and widespread dissemination.",

        "abstract": "During 2001-2005, an estimated annual 79,646 alcohol-attributable deaths (AAD) and 2.3 million years of potential life lost (YPLL) were attributed to the harmful effects of excessive alcohol use. An estimated 5,800 AAD and 189,667 YPLL were associated annually with suicide. The burden of suicide varies widely among racial and ethnic populations in the United States, and limited data are available to describe the role of alcohol in suicides in these populations. To examine the relationship between alcohol and suicide among racial/ethnic populations, CDC analyzed data from the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) for the 2-year period 2005-2006 (the most recent data available). This report summarizes the results of that analysis, which indicated that the overall prevalence of alcohol intoxication (i.e., blood alcohol concentration [BAC] at or above the legal limit of 0.08 g/dL) was nearly 24% among suicide decedents tested for alcohol, with the highest percentage occurring among American Indian/Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) (37%), followed by Hispanics (29%) and persons aged 20-49 years (28%). These results indicate that many populations can benefit from comprehensive and culturally appropriate suicide-prevention strategies that include efforts to reduce alcohol consumption, especially programs that focus on persons aged <50 years.",

Of 25 case-patients who developed HUS, including the initial 8 cases, half were 15years old, 67% were female and seven (28%) died. No common exposures were identified. Among 20 HUS case-patients tested, Shiga toxin was detected in the stools of 2 patients (one with elevated serum IgG titers to several Escherichia coli serogroups, including O111 and O104). Among 56 persons with only bloody diarrhea, we isolated Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) O104:H4 from 2 and Shigella from 10; 2 had serologic evidence of E. coli O26 infection. These cases may indicate a previously unrecognized burden of HUS in Georgia. We recommend national reporting of HUS and improving STEC detection capacity.",

Issues discussed included the current status of inhibitor surveillance in the United Kingdom (U.K.) and the U.S., the results of a U.S. inhibitor surveillance feasibility study, proposed national surveillance schemes, laboratory testing and reporting issues and potential opportunities for future inhibitor-related research. It was concluded that implementation of a national program of inhibitor surveillance using standardized testing through an established public health registry along with patient and care provider education and targeted research provide the best opportunity to inform efforts to develop and evaluate effective prevention strategies.",

In August 2008, ACIP expanded its seasonal influenza vaccination recommendations to also include all children aged 5--18 years no later than the 2009--10 season. To update previous estimates of seasonal influenza vaccination coverage among children aged 6 months--18 years, CDC analyzed data from the eight immunization information system (IIS) sentinel sites for the 2009--10 influenza season. Vaccination coverage with influenza A (H1N1) 2009 monovalent vaccine is not included in this report. Average (unweighted) vaccination coverage with >/=1 seasonal influenza vaccine doses was 26.3%, a 5.5 percentage point increase from the 2008--09 season (20.8%). Increases varied by age group, ranging from almost no increase among children aged 6--23 months (55.2% during the 2008--09 season to 55.7% during the 2009--10 season) to notable increases among children aged 2--4 years (from 33.0% to 38.4%), 5--12 years (19.0% to 27.1%), and 13--18 years (10.9% to 15.3%). Full vaccination coverage was low during the 2009--10 season, ranging from 34.7% among children aged 6--23 months to 15.3% among children aged 13--18 years. These findings highlight the need to identify varied strategies and venues for delivering influenza vaccine to different age groups of children to increase vaccination coverage.",

Cholera awareness and importance of rehydration was high but availability of oral rehydration salts was low. A total of 55 case-patients were matched to 110 controls. The odds of death were higher among males (adjusted odd ratio [AOR] = 5.00, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.54-14.30) and persons with larger household sizes (AOR = 1.21, 95% CI = 1.00-1.46). Receiving home-based rehydration (AOR = 0.21, 95% CI = 0.06-0.71) and visiting cholera treatment centers (CTCs) (AOR = 0.07, 95% CI = 0.02-0.23) were protective. Receiving cholera information was associated with home-based rehydration and visiting CTCs. When we compared cases and controls who did not go to CTCs, males were still at increased odds of death (AOR = 5.00, 95% CI = 1.56-16.10) and receiving home-based rehydration (AOR = 0.14, 95% CI = 0.04-0.53) and being married (AOR = 0.26, 95% CI = 0.08-0.83) were protective. Inability to receive home-based rehydration or visit CTCs was associated with mortality. Community education must reinforce the importance of prompt rehydration and CTC referral.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate for changes in sexual behaviors associated with daily pill-use among MSM participating in a PrEP trial. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Participants were randomized 1:1:1:1 to receive tenofovir disoproxil fumarate or placebo at enrollment or after a 9-month delay and followed for 24 months. METHODS: 400 HIV-negative MSM reporting anal sex with a man in the past 12 months and meeting other eligibility criteria enrolled in San Francisco, Atlanta, and Boston. Sexual risk was assessed at baseline and quarterly visits using Audio Computer-Assisted Self-Interview. The association of pill-taking with sexual behavior was evaluated using logistic and negative-binomial regression for repeated measures. RESULTS: Overall indices of behavioral risk declined or remained stable during follow-up. Mean numbers of partners and proportion reporting unprotected anal sex (UAS) declined during follow-up (p<0.05), and mean UAS episodes remained stable. During the initial 9 months, changes in risk practices were similar in the group that began pills immediately vs. those in the delayed arm. These indices of risk did not differ significantly after initiation of pill-use in the delayed arm or continuation of study medication in the immediate arm. Use of poppers, amphetamines, and sexual performance-enhancing drugs were independently associated with one or more indices of sexual risk. CONCLUSIONS: There was no evidence of risk compensation among HIV-uninfected MSM in this clinical trial. Monitoring for risk compensation should continue now that PrEP has been shown to be efficacious in MSM and other populations and will be provided in open-label trials and other contexts.",

        "abstract": "Tick-borne spotted fever group (SFG) rickettsioses are emerging human diseases caused by obligate intracellular Gram-negative bacteria of the genus Rickettsia. Despite being important causes of systemic febrile illnesses in travelers returning from sub-Saharan Africa, little is known about the reservoir hosts of these pathogens. We conducted surveys for rickettsiae in domestic animals and ticks in a rural setting in western Kenya. Of the 100 serum specimens tested from each species of domestic ruminant 43% of goats, 23% of sheep, and 1% of cattle had immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to the SFG rickettsiae. None of these sera were positive for IgG against typhus group rickettsiae. We detected Rickettsia africae-genotype DNA in 92.6% of adult Amblyomma variegatum ticks collected from domestic ruminants, but found no evidence of the pathogen in blood specimens from cattle, goats, or sheep. Sequencing of a subset of 21 rickettsia-positive ticks revealed R. africae variants in 95.2% (20/21) of ticks tested. Our findings show a high prevalence of R. africae variants in A. variegatum ticks in western Kenya, which may represent a low disease risk for humans. This may provide a possible explanation for the lack of African tick-bite fever cases among febrile patients in Kenya.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of two doses of a monovalent rotavirus vaccine (RV1) against hospital admission for rotavirus in Bolivia. DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: Six hospitals in Bolivia, between March 2010 and June 2011. PARTICIPANTS: 400 hospital admissions for rotavirus, 1200 non-diarrhea hospital controls, and 718 rotavirus negative hospital controls. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Odds of antecedent vaccination between case patients and controls; effectiveness of vaccination ((1-adjusted odds ratio)x100), adjusted for age and other confounders; and stratified effectiveness by dose, disease severity, age group, and serotype. RESULTS: In comparison with non-diarrhea controls, case patients were more likely to be male and attend day care but less likely to have chronic underlying illness, higher level maternal education, and telephones and computers in their home. Rotavirus negative controls were somewhat more similar to case patients but also were more likely to be male and attend day care and less likely to have higher level maternal education and computers in their homes. The adjusted effectiveness of RV1 against hospital admission for rotavirus was 69% (95% confidence interval 54% to 79%) with rotavirus negative controls and 77% (65% to 84%) with non-diarrhea controls. The effectiveness of one dose of RV1 was 36% and 56%, respectively. With both control groups, protection was sustained through two years of life, with similar efficacy against hospital admission among children under 1 year (64% and 77%) and over 1 year of age (72% and 76%). RV1 provided significant protection against diverse serotypes, partially and fully heterotypic to the G1P[8] vaccine. Effectiveness using the two control groups was 80% and 85% against G9P[8], 74% and 93%% against G3P[8], 59% and 69% against G2P[4], and 80% and 87% against G9P[6] strains. CONCLUSION: The monovalent rotavirus vaccine conferred high protection against hospital admission for diarrhea due to rotavirus in Bolivian children. Protection was sustained through two years of life against diverse serotypes different from the vaccine strain.",

Messages were content analyzed for its use of tenets of the EPPM. Overall, the findings reveal that the news coverage clearly emphasized the threat of DEC poisoning over the efficacy of avoiding being poisoned. In addition, quantitative analyses showed that the information provided by Ministry of Health of Panama (MINSA) and the local news outlets were widely divergent. These data indicate that the majority (82 per cent) of MINSA press releases included a balance of both threat and efficacy elements, compared with only 29 per cent of Panama newspapers. Panama newspapers tended to emphasize threat alone.",
